Autumn 2020 - First Ideas and failed Arts Council Application\
 \
Friday 23rd October 2020\
 \
I lay down on the couch with my laptop, wondering what to work on when Daniel texted me and asked where in the park we should meet. He was on his way, the message said. I remembered that I had asked him to meet, jumped up and got dressed. We could meet at the cafe and I could buy him a drink, I messaged back, as I left the house.\
The cafe was shut. I waited for Daniel on a bench. The sun was in my eyes but I felt relaxed and warm. I saw him approach and got up from the bench. We walked down to the Co-op where I bought us both fizzy drinks and chocolate bars. We walked around the cemetery and I told him about my plans for the funding application. I wanted to do some research and development for a new performance that would be filmed and turned into a video installation. I wanted to have the performance be about status and power and simple metaphors of orientation. I wanted to think about status in terms of these metaphors: up and down, above and below, high and low. \
I spoke about an old performance we had done that had a section in which we asked the audience about a story involving a dwarf and a giant, and I said that maybe we could have giant and dwarf characters in the performance. Daniel cringed and said that he had recently got to know a performer who had dwarfism and had come to realise that talking about \'91dwarves\'92 was pretty bad. I understood what he meant - the whole point of a lot of my work was to engage with bad cliches, reductionist phrasing and prejudiced ideas, but some things were obviously too taboo to use - for example - we would never refer to anti-black racist terms in a performance, even to critique or satirise them. But I had used the figure of \'91The Dwarf\'92 which obviously had a derogatory relationship to real people with dwarfism. \
We spoke more about this performer\'92s work. They were called Tammy. Tammy had originally had a drag act called Midgette Bardot but had started making work under their own name. I said that maybe they would be a good person to consult on the project or to collaborate with because they were obviously engaging with these stereotypes in an interesting way. Daniel said that if I wrote an email about the project then he would send it on.\

I had band practice in the early evening and I left the house feeling irritated. I got in the car and drove out of my estate. On the main road I drove behind a car going about 25 mph - I followed them all through New Cross, round through Deptford and up to Surrey Quays. Somehow, their very consistent speed managed to line up with the traffic and allowed us to cruise through a series of green lights. My mood improved substantially, and out loud I exclaimed that I loved this car\'92s vibe. I turned up my music and cruised behind my new friend, letting him in ahead of me when he was in the wrong lane by telling him to go ahead brother, be my guest. He turned off at Surrey Quays and I said out loud that it was said to see him go, but that I would remember him.\

 \
After lunch I ran upstairs to the bathroom to clean up before I left for Kingston. I was having an in person supervision so I thought I\'92d take advantage of the trip to wander around the campus, locate various facilities such as the moving image workshop, pick up my student ID and maybe do some work in the library to see how it felt.\
As I was brushing my teeth I thought about telling my supervisor about possibly working with Tammy. That made me think about my conversation with Daniel, and how it was only because he cringed with embarrassment and shame when I mentioned doing something with the Giant and the Dwarf characters that he ended up telling me about Tammy\'92s work. Developments in thinking and approach, insights, intuitive movements, inspiration - all of these could come from negative emotions as well as from analytical thought. Without Daniel\'92s embarrassment at my unthinkingly offensive use of the term \'91dwarf\'92, I wouldn\'92t have found out about Tammy, and been inspired to contact them and see if they were interested in starting a discussion and possible collaboration on the themes of status and metaphors of height and relative position. I recognised that this was an insight in itself, and that I should mention it to my first supervisor later. I resolved to write it down when I got the chance.\

We had a PhD seminar session on Zoom. I thought it started at 9am so I got up early, ate breakfast quickly and went for a run. I managed to shower, get dressed, make a thermos of coffee, and sit down at my computer at 8:57. I was very impressed with myself.\
I logged on at 9 and the Zoom window said that the meeting started at 10am. I groaned. A few minutes later the head of research emailed everyone saying that there had been some confusion about the start time and we were starting at 10.\
In the afternoon I phoned Tammy and spoke to them about the performance, and about how I was planning to write a funding application. They were really nice and it seemed like they were working with similar ideas to me. I told them about using a ladder in a performance and they said they used ladders in their performance. They told me about wanting to make a show where the audience had to sit in chairs that were too small for them. We spoke a bit about their access requirements. I came off the phone feeling really good, and spent a few hours re-writing my funding application.\

Monday 2nd November\
 \
I got up early, ate and went for a run. I had the first morning of two sessions of media training on Zoom. I\'92d signed up for it in a fit of enthusiasm at the start of my PhD but now I was doing it I didn\'92t know why I\'92d signed up.\
The session was run by two ex-BBC journalists, though I couldn\'92t find much about their work at the BBC when I googled their names while they did their introductory talk, only social media profiles and various pages in which they were described as expert media trainers and experienced ex-BBC journalists.\
One of the participants of the workshop had a very blurry camera, as though it was covered in butter. She rubbed it a few times but couldn\'92t get it to clear. She said she would have to wait for her kids to come home to help her with it. Eventually she said that she thought it was scratched and she couldn\'92t fix it.\
The ex-BBC journalists were nice, if a bit sniffy about academics who used long words. As they described what journalists wanted and how to give it to them, it just made me lose respect for journalism, or at least the straw man version of journalists they described. By the end of the session, though I still thought they were appealing to a form of common sense and generalist language that was more ideologically formed than they were aware of, I had garnered some good techniques and pointers on how to prepare for a media interview.\

 \
At the studio I worked on a drawing, cleaned up a sculpture and finished writing a literature review of a philosophy book. After lunch I read a journal article in which the authors reviewed loads of different psychology studies that proved conceptual metaphorical links between verticality and power, valence, rationality and abstraction. For some reason it made me think about making a big crown, so I drew a big crown on some foamboard, coloured it in and cut it out. I smudged all the pen when I cut it out but it looked kind of good. I could imagine my performer holding it or sellotaping it to his head.\
 \
Friday 6th November\
 \
At the studio I wrote a literature review of a journal article about psychological studies about the power of vertical metaphors. In one of the studies, the researchers had shown subjects pictures of animals positioned either at the top or bottom of screens and then asked the subjects how much they respected the animals. The idea of a maniacal researcher screaming HOW MUCH DO YOU RESPECT THIS OTTER made me laugh a lot.\
 \
 \
Tuesday 9th November\
 \
I went to the studio. I worked on my big drawing, then started writing a new literature review of a chapter from the book by Sarah Ahmed. I ended up writing a lot but I didn\'92t feel very clear in my head about which section I was writing about - I knew the ideas I wanted to write about, but I kept mixing them up as I wrote. I figured I would just write it out and then edit it later.\
I emailed the other funded PhD candidate and told him that I was reading Discipline and Punish by Michel Foucault and I thought he might be interested in it. His research was about prison riots and Foucault mentioned prison riots in his introduction. Maybe, I wrote, there might be some interesting ideas in it for him. He wrote back that he had been planning to read it. We decided to do a reading group. He said he had an architect friend who might be interested in joining.\
In the evening I did some research into a bit of motion graphics software I wanted to download. After Effects wasn\'92t really suitable for my computer because it couldn\'92t use the graphics card. I\'92d looked at various options - including buying an external graphics card or buying a whole new computer. I\'92d found out that there was a cheap bit of software that used my GPU called Motion, so I tried to download it from the app store, but I couldn\'92t download an old version that was compatible with my operating system. It pissed me off - when I wanted to pay for something, I couldn\'92t. I ended up torrenting the software and the torrent link came bundled with a load of other software as well.\
  When my wife was done on her Zoom we watched the quarter finals of the Great British Bake Off.\

 \
Thursday 11th November\
 \
I wrote a literature review of Sara Ahmed\'92s Performativity of Disgust. I got quite into it because of the sugar and caffeine so I wrote lots. When I finished it, I spent some time learning to use Blender. I downloaded a 3D ladder and then copied and pasted lots of ladders, rotating and spinning them so I spelled out the word \'91LADDER\'92 with ladders. Then I learned how to move the camera and record the movement. Then I learned how to render out as a video with a transparent background, and that you should normally try to render as an image sequence, which was good to know. I rendered a video out and was glad that it worked, though the camera movement didn\'92t seem to relate to the camera movement I had actually done. It was a start anyway.\
I went out to meet a friend. It was his birthday. I took two of the muffins along with a candle and a lighter. Me and my wife walked up to the park and then my wife left me to go and post some letters and have a walk. I queued for a coffee from the cafe. My friend arrived and we chatted while I waited. He kept being distracted by small dogs. It was embarrassing how much he started at small dogs. Kind of creepy, I thought. But he did really like them. He followed several \'93smol doggo\'92 accounts on Instagram.\

Monday 15th November\
 \
The director of the Hampstead studios and galleries had sent a BCC email to everyone they were working with in 2021. My residency exhibition was scheduled for  autumn 2021. The email was long and rambling and had a lot of references to Duchamp and how the artworld would be changed forever by Covid. It was a little bit embarrassing - he should have edited it really. The main point he wanted to make - and I knew this, because when we\'92d last spoken at the studio he\'92d laid it out - was that he was going to do lots of exhibitions in 2021 and to do so he was cutting the budget for the shows, so there would no longer be technical support or a photographer. He didn\'92t quite make this clear, but I emailed him anyway and said that it was all fine with me,\
I had a meeting with my third supervisor at 2. She was called Caiomhe, pronounced \'91queever\'92. She lived locally so we met in the park. She bought me a coffee and we sat outside on a bench. She had bought a bacon baguette and dogs kept coming over on the off chance. She was from the drama department at Kingston, so we talked about tragedy and comedy and their relationship to status. She was embarrassed about talking about what were probably quite boring, basic ideas for her, but for me they were interesting and new and just what I wanted to hear about. She spoke about a friend of hers who had done research into method acting and Pret a Manger staff training for front of house staff. She said that she would find a book she had read about reactionary politics which she thought I might be interested in. We talked for about an hour and a half but eventually it got cold and we said our goodbyes.\
\
 \
Wednesday 17th November\
 \
I got up and put my running stuff on. I did this to make sure that I didn\'92t decide not to run in between getting up and leaving the house. I ate breakfast, took a shit then said goodbye to my wife and left the house. I ran around the park twice, stopping once to re-tie my shoelaces and another time to change the podcast I was listening to.\
On the tube I re-read the intro to Michel Foucault\'92s Discipline and Punish. I was having a Zoom reading group about it the next day with, Richard the other funded PhD candidate who had started at the same time as me. I wanted to remember it even though I\'92d only read it a week or so ago. I found a good quote about power relations that I\'92d missed before, all about how Foucault wanted to understand power not as a privilege of a certain class, or a property of certain people, but rather a series of techniques or operations. I liked the idea of a \'91micro-physics of power\'92, but I didn\'92t really know what it was. Maybe it was these techniques or operations?\
 \
Thursday 19th November\
 \
I started reading an essay about Pret a Manger making its staff perform emotional labour. It was very interesting and gave me ideas for performance. I went back and forth between the essay I was reading by Jaswinder Blackwell-Pal, and my performance script. Whenever I found a good idea that I could use and extrapolate into an instruction for performance, I went over to my performance script and wrote it down. For example, in the article Blackwell-Pal wrote about how Pret wanted \'91authentic\'92 performances of emotion from their employees, so I went to my performance script and wrote a new instruction or scene in which I explain to my performers that I want them to be authentic, then I wrote another scene in which I explain to them that I want them to give it all they\'92ve got, put on a show. Later I came back and added a scene where I wanted them to give it 110% and other productivity cliches. Then sports cliches or winning cliches - show them who\'92s boss etc. Later in the article, Blackwell-pal wrote that sometimes Pret employees were told to tone down their emotional performances, so I went back to my performance script and wrote a scene where I told my performers to tone it down, keep it quiet, don\'92t go over the top etc. Then added a scene where I told them to do the opposite - to amp it up, get bigger, raise their game and other metaphors of scale tending towards up, above, or being big.\
 \
Monday 23rd November\
 \
At the studio I worked a little on a sculpture, then edited a literature review of Sara Ahmed\'92s Performativity of Disgust which I was going to discuss the next day at my supervision meeting. I thought about iteration and performativity, which Ahmed discussed in regards to the borders or divisions that are formed up through the re-performance of disgust. Then I realised that Ahmed herself practised a form of re-iterative performativity in her writing technique. She tended to hammer a word with different forms of analysis, looking at it this way and then that way, phrasing an interpretation of the word, and then rephrasing the same interpretation to get something else out of it. And through this, she somehow created the terms of how you read her, she created a web of associations that made sense through her logic, yes, but also through this repetition and iteration, this hammering home. It made me think about Sianne Ngai\'92s essay about Stan Douglas\'92s work. I googled Stan Douglas and decided to watch a lecture by him in the afternoon.\
After lunch I did some emails and then started watching a Stan Douglas lecture from 2008. It was good, he talked all about iteration and repetition, only he called it permutation, which was a good word. I took notes and occasionally paused the video and took down a direct quote. The two works he spoke most about were the works that Sianne Ngai had written about in her book and I wondered if she\'92d watched this lecture.\
I thought about why I wanted to do repetition and recombination in my work, and why Stan Douglas wanted to do repetition and recombination in his work. Douglas said in the lecture that he wanted to make a capitalist form of video art in which he put in a limited amount of video and sound material and came out with an incredible amount of possibilities, as though he had created value, just like the \'91magic\'92 of value explained by Marx by the surplus value in his labour theory of value. That was interesting to me, but I thought that I was more interested in what I thought of as Ahmedian reasons: creating, sustaining and reinforcing connections between ideas that might seem strange at first, but through repetition they became norms or conventions, but not already existing norms - new norms, subversive or absurd norms that existed for the duration of the work, and could be taken away as a set of possibilities by the viewer of the work.\
I had a Microsoft Teams meeting with someone from the Moving Image Workshop at Kingston. I asked him lots of questions about using the film studio and he answered all my questions. He was really nice and sent me a video about using the green screen, and was interested in some weird ideas that my camera operator had come up with about running a light on a dolly. He suggested that we could try attaching a light to a boom pole and moving it up and down too.\
After the meeting I went back to the Stan Douglas interview. At the end, in the Q&A session, he talked about good infinity and bad infinity, and how his films pretended that they were good infinity but were really only masquerading as good, and eventually revealed themselves to be bad infinity. I liked that.\
 \
Tuesday 24th November\
 \
I had an early Zoom session with my second supervisor. He was called Volker and was the director of research at Kingston. He confused me by asking me if I had thought about going part time because of the impact Coronavirus was having on the artworld. I hadn\'92t considered it, and I couldn\'92t tell if he was advising me to go part time or just informing me that it was an option.\
Volker made lots of good points about how my art practice should be the primary focus of my research and that I shouldn\'92t get bogged down in theory and big abstractions. The problem was that my art practice was often about big abstractions and theory, and getting bogged down in it was part of my process. Maybe that\'92s what I should be recording? The bogging down.\
We ate an early lunch and then I left to get the train to Kingston. I was picking up some equipment from the loan room, and then I had a supervision session with Dan at 4pm.\
  I got to uni and was directed to the loan room. It was closed, so I went back downstairs and used the toilet, then came back upstairs and sat on a chair until they came back from lunch at 2pm. I went and picked up my equipment and asked them a few questions about it, trying to be friendly and to make a good impression as I would no doubt be borrowing stuff over the next three years at Kingston. I had borrowed a DSLR and a tripod. As soon as I took the tripod from him I wished I hadn\'92t borrowed it - I had my own, slightly less sturdy tripod at home, which would have been completely fine for what I wanted to do, which was document a few artworks and take a self portrait for my research profile. Now I had to carry around a tripod, take it home, and then bring it all the way back to Kingston in two weeks' time. I almost took it back and said I didn\'92t need it but I didn\'92t want to make a weird first impression.\
  I went to the library and watched an excerpt of a Stan Douglas film and wrote notes about the excerpt. I liked the library but I didn\'92t like their chairs because they didn\'92t have very good back support.\
  I walked through the university, then out the back doors and across to the old pub that served as the MA studios. I phoned Dan and he came and opened the door.\
We chatted about a Sara Ahmed essay we\'92d both read. He didn\'92t offer a lot of opinions on it - though he raised a few good questions about her methods. We talked about my synopsis and trying to form a question from my title. Informed by my earlier discussion with Volker I suggested a radical rewrite option in which I shifted focus away from status and emotions, and onto something like modes of address, which might allow me to think about status and emotions, but not have them as my primary research area.\
 \
Thursday 26th November\
 \
I had a shower in the morning and after the shower thought something about how having a shower was about washing the shame away.\
I started a document where I wrote down possible questions that my work could be the answer to - that was the problem, I needed my work to be the answer to a question about art, rather than for my work to help answer a question about the subject matter of the artwork. It was hard to keep that clear in my head, but I just wrote down really badly worded questions, \'91What happens when status and emotions are the subject matter of performance and video?\'92 That was definitely a question that my work answered, but maybe it was a stupid question, but maybe that was better than having a clever, interesting question that my work didn\'92t answer. I shared the document with my supervisor.\
I started reading the introduction to a book about participation in theatre and performance. I highlighted some good bits of the introduction like a bit where the author wrote that there were few things in the theatre more despised than audience participation. The prospect of audience participation made people fearful and the use of audience participation made people embarrassed, the author wrote, not only for themselves but for the theatre makers who chose to inflict it on their audiences. I laughed at that bit, and thought that it was a good starting point for my work with participation as a way to explore unequal power relations - inflicting something on a group of people, and those people being embarrassed for the person doing the inflicting.\
 \
Monday 30th November\
\
Laying on the bed with my computer I read the introduction to a book about irony. As I copied over quotes from the book, I also made notes on what I thought might be an interesting connection between irony and performativity. I tweeted several thoughts I had. I tweeted that performative speech acts had an ironic relationship to ideology. The effects they generated were hidden by the simple descriptions they appeared to be. I added another tweet saying that in humour the success of irony depended on an audience who understood the double meaning of an ironic statement, but in ideological terms, performative statements were more powerful when fewer people recognised the ideological effects they generated. I added one more tweet. It used gender as an example, saying that when a midwife said 'It's a boy!' when a baby was born, the ideology of gender was strengthened if everyone heard the statement as a simple description of reality, rather than a constitutive statement that generated gender as an effect. I was pleased with that.\
 \
Tuesday 1st December\
 \
I woke up to my wife\'92s alarm. She snoozed it and we slept for another 20 minutes. When we got up she asked me to pass her the advent calendar her mum had bought for us. I joked that I was looking forward to eating my choccy, and my wife pointed at the front of the calendar: there was a little box where you could write your name, and she had written her name there. She told me it was her calendar.\
I went for a run. It was a cold beautiful day. I listened to a podcast about a book which compared irony and outrage: for the writer, irony was exemplified by American satire like the Daily Show, and outrage was exemplified by Fox News. Not once in the interview did the host or the interviewee consider the idea that the reason these two things could be compared was because they both appealed to very consistent norms, and the irony that was used in mainstream satire relied on views that were as unchangeable and as reliant on a status quo (if not the same status quo) as that of the average Fox News viewer. They just kept talking about the neuropsychology of conservatism.\
 \
Wednesday 2nd December\
\
I felt a lot of anxiety about my PhD, as though I was lost in something, but I didn\'92t know what. I carried on reading the PhD thesis of an artist. It had been recommended to me by Volker. I liked it, but because I was so stressed about the idea of getting a question sorted out for my research I kept reading the artist\'92s thesis trying to work out what question was being asked at every point. It made the whole thing quite hard work, and not very enjoyable. It felt like I was being unfair on the artist, by subjecting her published work to the kind of scrutiny that I was subjecting myself to, before I\'92d made or written any part of my thesis. \
 \
Saturday 5th December\
 \
Late afternoon we sat and read the paper and had a cup of tea, then I started reading an essay that an old friend from uni had written and sent me out of the blue. The essay was all about the Haiti slave revolution and, from what I could gather, the idea that the revolution was a uniquely modern demonstration of the immanent freedom of man - i.e., one of the few realisations of the modern idea of man as a free subject. I liked the idea, but I didn\'92t know loads about the Haitian revolution so I googled things occasionally. There was something in the essay about vodou - a haitian magical religion, combining West African voodoo with Roman Catholicism. I thought about performativity in language, and how it was a kind of magic, and no doubt performative magic was used a lot in magic - declaring something to have happened, or to be so, or summoning things, or demanding the future conform to your will.\
 \
Wednesday 9th December\
\
I wrote until 11, made coffee, then came back to my desk and wrote some more. I wrote about Logical Positivism and the verification principle, then I wrote a little about Wittgenstein, then I wrote a summary of J.L. Austin\'92s How to do things with words with some quotes from the book and some stuff from secondary sources. At one point I realised I had had an interesting thought in which I compared JL Austin\'92s writing on the value of truth when assessing speech to Nietzsche's idea of the transvaluation of values. It was quite a clever observation, I thought, and I was happy with it.\
I had an early lunch. I got to the end of the section on Austin and started to work on the Judith Butler section, but as I started to read through my notes and quotes from Gender Trouble I realised that in the opening of her 1999 preface to the 2nd edition of the book, she basically says that she took her idea of performativity from Derrida. This was good to find out - because part of the reason my supervisor was getting me to do this work was to understand where Butler was taking her idea of performativity from. But, it was also annoying, because I didn\'92t know any of Derrida\'92s writing on performativity. From the Wikipedia article on performativity I found an essay that seemed relevant, where Derrida wrote directly about Austin\'92s idea of performativity.\
I got my laptop and brought it downstairs, made myself a cup of tea and started reading this essay. I made very detailed notes - writing a summary after each quote that I copied over, and when I couldn\'92t really quote a section I would try to summarise it. It was weird how sometimes I couldn\'92t really understand what I\'92d read, but I could still summarise it. Often, the bits I didn\'92t understand, when I started writing, I ended up understanding them. Sometimes in summarising what I\'92d just read, I predicted what Derrida was going to write in the next section - though only in a very general way.\
At one point Derrida wrote that the way that Austin freed the analysis of the performative from the value of truth was nothing less than Nietzschean and I was very excited because that\'92s what I\'92d thought of earlier. After the quote, I wrote that I had thought this thought earlier, and that maybe I was Derrida - or maybe I was the Borgesian Don Quixote writer version of Derrida or something, reproducing his working perfectly without copying him.\
 \
Thursday 10th December\
 \
I sat in the living room reading the Derrida essay about a Kafka short story called Before the Law and taking notes. I got the quotes I needed, the ones that Judith Butler was probably referring to when she said in her 1999 preface to Gender Trouble that she had taken her reading of the performativity of gender from the Derrida essay I was reading.\
I read a short essay by Sianne Ngai about Lauren Berlant and it gave me some ideas for how I might describe what I wanted to do in my PhD: things like how I could use affect as an intellectual tool, and how affect always took place in the present, and so a study of affect was a study of the present. I wondered if I could think about emotion as taking place in an extended present. Maybe durational artwork took place in the extended present?\
Friday 11th December\
\
  On the way up to my studio I read the intro to another book but Judith Butler, this time about hate speech and performativity. I highlighted sections and decided that when I got to the studio I\'92d finish reading the intro on my laptop and upload all highlights I\'92d made.\
  Once I got to the studio I realised I didn;t have the little adaptor which meant I could plug the Kindle into my laptop, so instead, I went through the intro on my kindle, matching up highlighted quotes to a pdf on my laptop, and then copying and pasting the sections from the pdf into my referencing software. Then I went through the notes, summarising and writing comments. Then I carried on reading the intro on my laptop, copying and pasting from the pdf into my referencing software.\
Eventually my back hurt and I decided to do something else. I got my big drawing off the wall and started colouring in the background in a patchwork of different green felt tips. It reminded me of when I was a kid and coloured in all the bricks of Humpty Dumpty\'92s wall a different colour for a colouring in competition and got second or third place and my mum had said that they must have thought I was a kid with special needs, which now I thought about it was quite a mean thing to say, though I\'92d always found it very funny - the idea of being different and messy and unaesthetic must have appealed to me from a fairly young age.\
  While I worked on the big drawing I listened to a podcast on Derrida and Foucault and fashion. The guest on the podcast said that she had seen Derrida speak when he was very old and he had reminded her of a ski instructor, with very tanned, glowing skin.\
 \
Monday 14th\
 \
I read and took notes from a Derrida essay all day. The notes made sense at the time, and I understood everything as I wrote it down, and yet, when I came back to the essay after a break, it suddenly seemed like nonsense or my notes seemed to state obvious contradictions. That was the problem with Derrida, it was all so striking, that when you summarised it, it seemed obvious, or incorrect.\
\
Monday 21st December\
 \
I didn\'92t get the Arts Council DYCP grant that I\'92d applied for. I felt sad, but nothing much else. I had to email Dan and Tammy to tell them. They were both nice about it. Tammy said that we would work out a way to do the project, they were sure of it.\

Monday 4th January 2021\
 \
I decided to apply for a development bursary with a gallery based in Cardiff. I thought I\'92d try to roll it into an Arts Council application as well - use it as match funding and then pay for some extra time working with Tammy and Daniel performers and a camera person on some new work. \

I drank coffee and wrote about metaphors and performativity for a while. I was quite happy with what I\'92d written. I\'92d started to see a connection between metaphors, performativity, iteration and comedy. I had this idea that \'91non-serious\'92 performativity could be a useful way of describing what happened in my performances and videos.\
I ate my lunch and read a long essay about the end of Jacques Lacan\'92s life where his son-in-law was taking over his legacy and there was lots of infighting and sniping between grand old psychoanalysts. There was a good bit where someone who\'92d been analysed by Lacan said that sometimes Lacan\'92s secretary would come in while they were doing a session and tell Lacan that he had a phone call. Lacan would leave to take the call, and tell the person being analysed that they should carry on while he was gone. I copied and pasted the quote into twitter and tweeted it because it made me laugh. I also tweeted a quote about Freud sending Lacan a postcard but accidentally writing his own son\'92s address on it.\

 \
I went for a run and then had a Teams meeting with my first supervisor. We had a good chat and he recommended some good art historical texts. I spoke a lot and as I was speaking some ideas came together. He thought that \'91misfirings and unhappiness\'92 which is what I\'92d called my essay on performativity might be a good title for my PhD. He said that perhaps the conclusion of my essay might be a good starting place for the introduction to my thesis. We chatted about comedy and modes of address.\

 \
I woke up early again. Me and my wife went out at the same time, me for a run and her for a walk. Instead of running around the park I ran up the steep hill on the south side of the park four times in a row and then walked home exhausted.\
I had a Zoom meeting with Volker. We talked about the possibility of my PhD being about aboutness, that is, it could ask and answer the question of what it was to make a work about something, and to deploy aboutness as a method that had effects outside and in excess of describing or explaining a topic.\
We had lunch, and while I was washing up I had an idea to write an introduction to my PhD that foregrounded questions of aboutness. I made coffee and ran upstairs feeling very inspired. I wrote a kind of serious/not serious poetic reflection on aboutness and what aboutness is about - like a kind of comic philosophical investigation into the language of aboutness. It was good.\

 \
My wife told me she still hadn\'92t come on her period. We went for a walk around the park before she started work and she talked about how, if she was pregnant, which she probably wasn\'92t, then she would find it sad and hard to tell her sister, because her sister was still struggling to get pregnant through IVF. She said she had googled it, and if she was pregnant then the baby was the size of a poppy seed and had three layers. It had a neural tube. She said it had freaked her out that by five weeks it was the size of an apple seed. I said that an apple seed was quite a lot bigger than a poppy seed and she said that was why she had been freaked out.\

 \
My wife had woken up before me and urinated on two pregnancy tests. When I woke up we went to look at them and they were both positive. \
 \
Friday 30th January\
 \
I was so tired when I got up. I\'92d been up three times in the night. I had a headache. The last part of my dream I remembered was a little boy in pain because he\'92d been eating metal.\
In the evening we watched a film called The Platform. It was all about people living in a hierarchical prison where the people at the top ate some food, and then everyone else had to eat the leftovers of the floor above them - the platform of the title was the thing that transported the food down the levels.\

 \
I went for a long walk with Daniel. We talked about his work as a neurodiversity mentor. Because he had done lots of work about neurodiversity, he had lots of mentoring work for younger artists who were very earnest about the conversations around the politics of neurodiversity and he said that sometimes it made him feel like a baby boomer because occasionally he couldn\'92t be bothered to talk about access or safe spaces and didn\'92t really care about it, and though he had sound reasons for these feelings, sometimes he felt with younger people, that even if he presented them in a sound and evidenced way, they would somehow cross a red line and he would be banished from this work. So, even though he sometimes felt conflicted about the very aims and objectives of the projects undertaken by his mentees, he could never question their ethical or political assumptions, because if he did he wouldn\'92t get any more of that kind of work, and it was giving him some much needed income after losing quite a lot of his teaching work.\

 \
I woke up before 7 and came downstairs. It was snowing and the snow was laying on the ground, although it must have been snowing on and off for almost 24 hrs and still wasn\'92t thick on the ground.\
We got dressed and went for a walk. It was horrible. The wind blew the snow directly into our faces. The pavements were icy. We walked up the hill in the park and suddenly my wife felt very sick. She bent over and let saliva dribble out of her mouth. We walked home.\
My wife sat on a chair in the front room, drinking small sips of soda water and eating a banana. She said she would lie on the sofa and look at her laptop.\
I went upstairs and worked on the bed, transferring quotes from Andrea Buttner\'92s book on shame and art into my referencing software. I heard my wife walk slowly and purposefully upstairs, go into the bathroom and vomit into the toilet. Once she had finished, I got up and guided her to bed. I went downstairs and got her water, her laptop, her phone and charger and brought it up to her, along with a ginger biscuit and a rice cake and a tiny bit of banana  that she hadn\'92t eaten yet. She looked very tired and pitiful. I kissed her and told her to tell me if she needed anything.\
I made coffee and filled a thermos flask with it. I took it upstairs and had a Zoom meeting about my PhD upgrade. It was too cold to take off my dressing gown and hat so I just dealt with it and tried not to worry about feeling embarrassed later. Reading the shame book had made me think that I should try harder not to be embarrassed, or not to worry about embarrassment as much.\

 \
I woke up before 7. I ate oats and an apple and then did some yoga. I looked outside and it seemed like the ice had melted or was not as bad so I went out for a walk, with the intention of running as well. It turned out that the pavements were still icy, so I ran in the road, but there were enough cars on the road to make this annoying so I walked mostly. But, because I was only wearing a jumper, walking wasn\'92t enough activity to keep me warm. I went home after 15 minutes or so.\
I started drawing out my PhD as a diagram. First I did key terms, with lots of sub headings and then lots of lines going between the different ideas and techniques, connecting them up: comedy with misfiring performatives, but also with conventions and norms in the power section. Power operations as a set of techniques or methods including performative language, but also the abstract concept of power as a subject, \'91aboutness\'92 as its own section, connecting to my subjects: power and emotions, but also connected to methods and performatives - aboutness as a technique, a way of making or positioning work, and also as a act with a certain set of effects on the way the subject matter was thought of by the audience.\

 \
In the evening we watched Snowpiercer, a film by the Korean director who\'92d made Parasite. I hadn\'92t realised that it was an American production, with mostly English speaking actors and then a few famous Korean actors. It was all about a world in which the only remaining humans all lived on a huge train, with rich people at the front, and an underclass in the \'91tail\'92, who lived in cramped conditions, and ate protein blocks made from mashed up insects. I was interested in watching it because it was a literalised metaphor of hierarchy. The film itself was a fairly straightforward action movie, but because of this, it made clear all the different parts of the structure of the metaphor - the locked gates between each section, the analogy between the train and a human body - the head and the shoe was the way one of the characters put it. We had watched another film a few weeks before called The Platform which was a literalisation of a vertical hierarchy metaphor, where people lived above and below each other. I thought it was interesting to compare them.\
  That evening I drank a can of beer and two glasses of red wine. Since the 1st of January I had only drunk one can of beer. I enjoyed the beer and the first glass of wine, but not really the second glass of wine. When I went to bed I had a headache. I\'92d forgotten about that part of drinking.\

 \
We woke up late after a broken night\'92s sleep. Some time in the night my wife had woken up complaining about a pain in her stomach. She was worried it was the baby - maybe a miscarriage. She went to the toilet and did a poo and then came back to bed. She was still worried, she said, but she fell asleep. I got up and went to the toilet. When I came back to bed I did two long farts. With that I realised we\'92d both just got a bit of indigestion.\
I read a Philip Auslander essay on Vito Acconci. It wasn\'92t very insightful but it gave me a performance studies perspective on the work as being about body, and body as allegory, rather than what I thought about when I watched them, which was more the language: the poetry of power and coercion.\
 \

 \
I went for a run for the first time in ages. It was hard but it made me feel very positive. In the morning I had a CARC seminar. I asked a question right at the end, but it was a bit malformed and as I spoke I realised I was semi-summarising the artist\'92s own work back to them but not as good and then my question was basically whether they meant to do that or not. Their response was very kind and they found a slightly better question in my question about their relationship to literary theory and I took notes. I felt slightly ashamed after the session but I tried to shrug it off - it was ok to make an idiot of yourself. If I wanted to learn I had to not buy into my own embarrassment about not knowing.\
 \

 \
I had a PhD supervision meeting at 10. We spoke about the upgrade. Dan didn\'92t really know anything about the process, and promised to find out more by the next time we met. We read through the guidance documents together and got an idea roughly of what I should be doing.\
We finished and I filled in some supervision records - documents I was meant to fill in after every supervision meeting but hadn\'92t been doing, but had realised I needed for my upgrade. Then I started a new document and put all of the required elements for the upgrade in the document, then I copied and pasted the latest versions of these things - questions, methodology, abstract, contribution to knowledge - into the document. Then I filled in the bits I hadn\'92t already got elsewhere, including describing what work I would include as links to videos and stills and scripts with annotation. The abstract was a bit out of date, so I updated it slightly - adding in a bit about heuristic emotions which was a term I\'92d taken from Andrea Buttner\'92s writing on shame. I just shoved a sentence in about it, thinking that I could edit it properly later.\

I spent the morning walking with my performer Daniel. We talked a lot about transgression. We sat on a bench in Blythe Hill Fields, looking out at canary wharf and my performer spoke about how for him, things that sometimes appeared as transgressive were just the best ways he knew of being. We spoke about a lecture he\'92d done where he held a hammer in his hand while he spoke, and occasionally banged the hammer on things as part of the lecture. He said it was about access. If he needed to have a hammer to do a lecture, then he needed a hammer. It wasn\'92t an attempt at transgression, and if it transgressed any norms or conventions, then they weren\'92t particularly important ones. But then, at the same time, this kind of accidental transgression also fascinated him, the moments where you thought things were ok, but they weren\'92t, that something was fine, but it wasn\'92t. At some point my performer went quiet, then he got up and crossed the path to the grass. There was a log with a fox shit on it, and my performer looked at it and said he was sorry but he couldn\'92t carry on talking while this was in his eyeline. He kicked it over and came back to the bench and we carried on talking.\
 \
Friday 26th February 2021\
 \
I woke very early and had to get out of bed. I kept having shameful thoughts about things I\'92d done as a teenager - not actually bad things, but rather minor incidents of rudeness or aggression that the other people involved almost certainly had no recollection of. In fact, if I tried to think of times when I could remember other people being unnecessarily rude or hostile, I couldn\'92t bring to mind a single one.\
In the afternoon I read a book about Shakespeare called Talking to the Audience, all about the bits in shakespeare plays where the actor talked, as a character, directly to the audience, and looking at how these non-naturalistic sections, in which the character could be understood as breaking the fourth wall, could be understood as an interesting, anti-naturalistic form of characterisation in which the character\'92s and the actors desires collided - the desire to perform well, to be liked, to push forward certain interpretations of their words, were feelings of the actor that could coincide with their version of the character. I liked it - it was cultural materialism but the writer wanted to keep things like character. She had a term, from her interpretation of Stanislavski\'92s idea of the character\'92s objective. She said that actors and characters could have a performance objective - how they wanted to appear to an audience, and that could be very helpful to characterisation more generally, and a form of characterisation that was based on performance rather than script, or research or naturalism or psychologism.\
 \
Tuesday 2nd March 2021\
 \
I woke up in the dark, with my mind full of half asleep anxieties about what would happen after my PhD. I would need a job, but I would not be able to get one. I would have to go back to art technician work to support our child. We would be stuck in London, or I would have to commute to London, spending 30% of my day\'92s wages on a train ticket, coming home late and having no time to make art.\
Mixed up in these big anxieties were smaller, localised worries about my PhD.  I wouldn\'92t ever be able to write an abstract that made any sense and successfully encapsulated my project. I didn\'92t have a thesis, but then I didn\'92t want thesis that could be put into words, because my artworks were meant to be my thesis, but then I couldn\'92t describe all my artworks and their findings until I made them, so the task of writing an abstract was essentially impossible but I wasn\'92t clever enough or literate enough to trick any readers into believing that I did know what I was doing.\
All of these thoughts churned around in my head until I got up. I went downstairs in the dark and ate some breakfast. I reasoned that I was anxious, generally, and that the anxiety had attached to some specific - real, and reasonable - worries, but that I should remember that those worries were very different. Job/money worries were medium long term and I was going to work hard over the next few years to get some regular teaching work to underpin my career as an artist. And worries about my PhD were short/medium term and worrying about them, though annoying, was part of the thought process that would eventually result in me resolving these problems of the relationship  between my practice as research and art history, and between my practice as research, and writing.\
In the evening we watched a documentary about Max Clifford. It was full of weird details that reminded me of my research - his whole public life was about exposure, good and bad - getting celebrities media exposure, and supplying details to expose other celebrities and politicians in sex and drug scandals. But his whole life he also had a sex life that revolved around exposure - exposing himself to women, forcing them to masturbate him, and risking exposure for this - doing it in situations where if any woman ever reported him, he would be exposed and shamed. One detail: he would sometimes ask women if his penis was the smallest penis they had ever seen in their entire lives, so for him, this exposure involved exposing his penis, which he believed was tiny - shamefully so, the smallest penis a woman might have ever seen. For him, presumably, having other people know that he had a tiny penis would also have been a form of exposure. Exposure, fear of exposure and shame.\
In one scene, media spoke to him on the day of his sentencing. My wife asked me what I thought it would be like to know that you were going to be sentenced to a long time in prison. I said I didn\'92t know, but that for Clifford, it seemed to me that there would be a strange sort of resolution for a judge to officially punish him for being exposed for exposing himself. Public shame was an endpoint, a kind of closure. Maybe even the true object of all his exposures. Shame as truth. Humiliation as an epistemic feeling: a feeling that finally everyone knew \'91the truth\'92.\

At 11 I had a Zoom interview with an artist and curator called Claire Undy who curated a digital platform called Skelf. She had seen some videos I\'92d made and wanted me to do something. I drank coffee while we spoke and went off about digital attention and then when it came to introducing my idea I went a bit manic and couldn\'92t quite explain everything in time but she was very generous and we had a good chat. When I spoke about status she asked me whether I had read the Keith Johnstone book about improvisation and I was excited because I had read that book in 2019 and it was one of the books that made me realise I could do a whole PhD on this stuff.\
I proposed to do a performance to camera piece that operated as a randomised sequence of videos on the website that worked with clock time over the course of a day. So the performers slept from 10-8am, had breakfast at 8-9, then \'91worked\'92 doing weird performance shit all day from 9-5, then looked at their phones for an hour, then had dinner, then sat with their laptops watching videos or browsing youtube or laughing at stuff until 10, then bed again.\

\
I spent the morning writing a talk for Kingston BA students, trying to use the process to work out what exactly my PhD was about, which was making me very anxious in a weird way where I felt like I couldn\'92t actually focus on the central idea of the subject of my PhD without it feeling like I was looking at death or infinity or something else incomprehensible. Whenever I was actually doing something - like for example while I wrote my talk for the BA students, it all made sense and flowed and held together, but when I stepped back and tried to understand it as a whole thing, or maybe tried to summarise it, or thought about the abstract, I felt only horror. \
Perhaps horror was an epistemic feeling? Perhaps I could include my horror at the PhD format which somehow seemed to spiral off into infinity whenever I thought about trying to pin down what my PhdD was about, in the PhD? Maybe my PhD was about the epistemic horror of doing a PhD?\

 \
My wife went to have her first proper appointment with the midwife and then went to work. In the morning I had a crit with the other residents from Kingsgate. It was good and helpful, and the conversation we had about their work was good. At the end we spoke about timings for our exhibitions at the project space. Me and Ruth would be in September or October. I realised mine would have to be September because we would have a baby at the end of September so that would be bad timing. Whereas if it was in September then the deinstall might be a bit hectic but otherwise it would be fine. I didn\'92t say, because I felt weird about telling people before the 12 week scan, but maybe I would email the director of Kingsgate and explain.\
 \
Sunday 7th March 2021\
 \
I met my friend who was doing a PhD about Japanese social practice at the Greenwich foot tunnel. He\'92d already walked an hour from his house in Limehouse. We talked about novels, and then about him having to give a presentation about his PhD project in Japanese as the culmination of the language course he\'92d been doing. We spoke about language. He said that in Japanese, \'91interesting\'92 never described something that was more than a novelty, so he had to be careful when responding to things, because like so many artists, his immediate reaction to most things was to pronounce it interesting.\
We ended up walking for about two and a half hours. We spoke mostly about PhDs. He was meant to be going to Japan in November but wasn\'92t sure what would happen. We spoke about his fear of being visible in the wrong way, and how this held him back from committing to an academic or artistic career. We spoke about how we both made things more complex in our artwork because maybe it was easier to have things be slightly confusing than to try to make things clear and be misunderstood. I spoke about the pain and horror of trying to write my abstract and we spoke about the perils of me making work \'91about\'92 things, and then the PhD being \'91about\'92 my work, but not \'91about\'92 the things my art was \'91about.\

 \
I resolved to sort out the studio. My wife went to work. I loaded up the car with what I needed and drove to B&Q. I bought wood for shelves and desks. I bought a dustpan and brush. I bought an oil heater. I bought blu roll. I bought an extension lead which I wasn\'92t sure I\'92d need but got anyway.\
On the way back to the studio I realised that I\'92d forgotten some tools I needed. I drove back to the house and picked them up. I also swapped one sheet of MDF from B&Q for a bit of ply I had at home that would make a better desk.\
At the studio I put up the shelf brackets and made some big shelving units. It took me a while how to put them up and ensure they wouldn\'92t be unstable but eventually I was confident they would be secure.\
I set up my desk and got all my materials out. All the stuff I wouldn\'92t use, I put into a box and put up on the top shelf. My desk looked nice and I was happy with it.\
All this took me up until lunch. By the time I got home I was starving so I made a large amount of pasta and ate it hungrily while reading the LRB.\
In the afternoon I wrote up two different abstracts and sent them to my first supervisor. Then for the rest of the afternoon I worked on some text for my third supervisor about direct address or talking to the audience. I wrote furiously and enthusiastically. It was like sorting out the studio had pulled some anxiety plug and I could now undertake the tasks that the week before I had found impossible to think about. I was unblocked.\
My wife was tired. She said she couldn\'92t stand the idea of another night of watching telly, but in the end we watched the second episode of a boring Netflix series we\'92d started the night before. I enjoyed it because I was feeling good about the work I\'92d done and I was still enjoying having two sofas in the living room so we could both lay down.\
 \
Tuesday 9th March 2021\
 \
I was up very early, like 6am. I got up, ate, then went for a walk. In the park I ran up the steep hill four times then walked home. I had a shower and started work. Over the course of the  morning I finished a first draft of the piece I was writing for my third supervisor. I drank a huge cup of coffee, it nearly overfilled the Sports Direct mug.\
We had mackerel pasta for lunch, then I went down to the studio. It was a bit chilly, so I wrapped myself in a blanket and turned my radiator on. I spent some time drawing, planning a big drawing that would be called something like Art History or literary criticism or something. Or it would be called The Box is a Metaphor. It depicted the Creep with his long nose sticking into the eponymous box, then a foot crushing the Creep\'92s head. What was happening in the box was shown in dotted outline as though it was only visible to the viewer, and what was happening was that an arm was just about to stab a pick through the nose of the Creep. All the different bits of the picture had labels or signs on them saying things like, artistic intention, personal taste, art history, the gaze of the elites, but halfway through I remembered that normally I turned everything into a single word noun. It didn\'92t matter, I could sort all that out on the big picture. I stuck the drawing up by a big bit of paper that I\'92d already clipped to the wall. I kind of needed another big desk, but I couldn\'92t really justify spending any money on it, so I\'92d have to wait until I could acquire some wood or a desk from somewhere.\
 \
Thursday 11th March 2021\
 \
I spent the morning reading a text by David Dibosa about embarrassment and race. It  was good, so I emailed him asking if he had any more writing on negative emotions, and also whether he\'92d be interested in coming on the podcast. He seemed like someone who was maybe quite high up in his profession and might be unbothered by the idea of appearing on my podcast, but nothing bad could come of it, so I sent it despite thinking that I probably wouldn\'92t get a reply.\
I thought I might work on the music for the Nottingham artist but ended up doing other stuff, then having a coffee and writing out a draft for my Arts Council application.\
 	After dinner I had a meeting with a curator who had commissioned a video project from me. As well as the curator was an american artist with a short cool dorky hairstyle, and his partner appeared, another dorky cool artist, but with a moustache, then a female British artist appeared as well.\
The first person to go was the American artist and they introduced themselves as she/her and then laughed and said she knew she was a bearded lady and everyone laughed. Then their partner introduced themselves but didn\'92t say their pronouns, then the woman, who was she/her, then I said I was he/him. To introduce myself I said that I had made a video for series one but I had been meant to make three videos. Because of covid I had had to cut back to one, and now we were releasing another one for season 2, but, I said, I knew white cis guys tended to dominate spaces, so it was undecided whether we should publish the third video with the third series, and we would only do so if it felt relevant. But the theme for season 2 seemed relevant, so I was happy to publish the new video with it.\
The duo introduced their project, something about how to not use Facebook and Twitter. The woman introduced her project, something about motherhood.\
I introduced my project, the second in three videos about power. The last one was about metaphors, and this one would be about gestures, in particular, handshakes. I went into some story about a conversation I\'92d had with a friend about their Arab lesbian friend who had told them that handshakes could be quite sexual between women in Arab culture. I said I wouldn\'92t include this in this work, but that it was exciting that the research was leading to these conversations. I felt a bit embarrassed about telling them about this, but I was trying to ingratiate myself with an audience who I knew would see me as a white straight man, which was what I was.\
The trans woman artist said she had a few questions and I said that was fine. As she started talking I realised that she was maybe taking aim at me in a way that was not going to be pleasant. She asked if I was going to take a materialistic approach to my critique of power. Then she asked me if I was going to include tacit knowledge bases in my work, considering that, as I\'92d mentioned, I was a white, straight, man, who was also, she presumed, middle class. And then she asked me something that didn\'92t quite form a question but ended with her saying that if I made a film about power without doing these things mentioned in the previous questions, then I would be enacting violence.\
I took lots of notes because I was panicked and embarrassed. I could see there was not a way to successfully answer these questions. And as the last question had turned into a long statement about me inhabiting hegemonic power structures founded on violence, then I thought the best thing to do was ask if there was a way she could rephrase it as a question.\
She didn\'92t manage to rephrase it as a question, but instead kind of restated it again, but slightly less aggressively. I tried to explain that no, my film wasn\'92t about the material effects of power, but I realised as I did so, that she had effectively set up the question by saying that any study of power that didn\'92t study the material effects of power was invalid, or, even worse, an act of violence. My explanation petered out.\
The trans woman artist\'92s partner stepped in, and tried to sound conciliatory, offering me advice about how to make my film more multivocal. Then the female artist stepped in, explaining gently that she had had to make her film with lots of mothers, because her voice wasn\'92t enough to track the multitude of experiences. I took lots of notes and nodded my head, almost bowing to the zoom camera. Shame and panic filled my stomach.\
I asked the trans woman artist if she had watched my film, she said she had watched maybe the first few minutes. I asked her what she meant by tacit knowledge, though I knew what she meant - she meant the knowledge of the powerless. She meant not my knowledge.\
Eventually we got back on a slightly more even keel. I felt like I\'92d endured something very extreme, but also knew that it had not been very extreme - it had been a critical conversation about art on a Zoom call. It was not nothing, but it was very little. Her critique, about me, was correct, but there wasn\'92t anything I could do about it, because it was about me, really, rather than something I\'92d done, or my art, which she hadn\'92t looked at. Though obviously, I knew that if she watched my video, she would probably have even more painful criticisms, so in a way, I was glad she hadn\'92t seen it.\
The producer told us about dates for handing in our content, and the trans woman artist and her partner said that because of systemic issues, they would not be able to give their work in at that date. The producer I knew had already pushed back their deadlines, but said it was ok, and that he could push it back for two more weeks. He asked us if that was ok, and the woman artist said it was fine and I did too.\
I got off the call and was totally freaked out but for some reason I couldn't tell my wife. We watched TV. The producer emailed me and asked me if I was ok, apologised for not knowing how to handle such a theoretical and personal exchange. I didn\'92t want to cause a scene so I just replied that he shouldn\'92t worry, that I thought they were interesting points, but I probably wouldn\'92t be able to incorporate the artist\'92s critique into these particular works. I wrote that because she hadn\'92t watched my work, it seemed to be more about me than the work, which was fair enough, because I was exactly what she had said I was. I tried to lighten the mood by using lots of exclamation marks. I thanked him for checking in.\
It took me a long time to get to sleep.\
 \
Friday 12th March 2021\
 \
I woke up at 5am when the bin man came round and wheeled out the recycling bins. I felt relaxed but couldn\'92t stop thinking about the previous night. I tried to not reject the shame, because that meant thinking nasty thoughts about the trans woman artist. I tried to dwell in the feeling, and not judge the feeling, to let it flow without trying to reject it or push it away. I thought it through and decided that though they had some good points about the politics of the representation of power, the feeling of panic and shame was overwhelming my ability to incorporate their critique in a way that made sense within the video I was making.\
  By 6am I had to get up because I was wide awake. I went downstairs and made a cup of ginger tea. I found the trans woman artist on instagram and browsed her work - she was Portuguese maybe, and made lots of works calling out the trans and homophobic nature of different things. I was not interested in the work. That made me feel better. We were in different art worlds. Her points were points I needed to address in my life, but I would never make the type of work she would want all artists to make. My work wasn\'92t about minority positions, or problematizing art world institutions, and it wasn\'92t a way of performing allyship. It was not committed artwork, in the Adornian sense. I decided that I wouldn\'92t email anyone about this, or talk to anyone about it today or over the weekend. I didn\'92t want to let the panic and shame make me tell the story in a defensive or resentful way.\
My wife woke up and I made her a cup of tea. When I gave her the cup of tea I looked out the window and noticed how dirty it was. I said to my wife we should get them cleared,\
I went to B&Q to take back an extension lead, then to Sainsburys to do the shopping. I felt happy and safe knowing that I was doing banal, everyday things, rather than being accused of enacting hegemonic violence. I walked down the cleaning products aisle, even though I knew we didn\'92t need any cleaning stuff. As I walked I thought back to earlier in the morning when I\'92d looked at the dirty window and wanted to clean it. I was trying to clean off the shame, I thought to myself. It was funny to notice something like that. I wondered if it was true? Maybe. We lived with these metaphors and they structured the way we thought about things like shame, like power.\
In the evening I felt ready to tell Em about the night before. I told her the story in detail and explained how it had made me feel. She said she was sorry that it had happened but that I should maybe try to work on how I responded to these things, because they would happen again in the future if I carried on being an artist. She had a point.\

 \
We cleaned the house and then Em went out for a walk with her friends. I read more of a book about talking to the audience. It was really good - really helpful for my PhD, but I wished it wasn\'92t about Shakespeare. I didn\'92t know or really like Shakespeare, and couldn\'92t bring myself to properly read the quotes she had used.\
I liked the idea of the locus and the platea. The locus was the setting where the fictional story took place in theatre, and the platea was a kind of liminal setting where the characters spoke to the audience. I thought maybe my PhD could be called \'91Art on the Platea: Talking to the Audience in Performance and Video\'92.\
I finished my reading and decided to do some DIY. I had to hang some uprights for some shelves in the second bedroom. I cleared away the bags and boxes from the alcove, brought all my tools upstairs, and measured up. When I drilled the top holes, they went in fine, giving me enough space for the wall plugs, but with the lower holes my drill just wasn\'92t powerful enough to pierces the concrete behind the brick. It was one of the reasons I hated doing DIY in the house - sometimes, the walls were just completely impervious to my drill. But you never knew. Some of the concrete gave way, but some of it didn\'92t. I cut off some half wall-plugs, and used them in the shallow holes I had been able to drill. This worked fine on one hole, but on the other side, it pulled a little chunk of plaster off the wall. I swore and cursed and muttered to myself. It occurred to me that one day I should record myself doing DIY and put it out as an audio artwork called the humiliation of DIY or something.\
Eventually I got one more screw in the wall on the second upright and decided to leave it at that. It was stable and would probably be strong enough, even if it wasn\'92t as secure as I\'92d like it to be. I felt unsatisfied and humiliated by the house.\
I went downstairs and marked out the wood to cut into shelves. I had to cut it on our garden table which was a very rickety piece of furniture. I sword and cursed and muttered as I cut, with the saw getting stuck in the wood. Luckily it was MDF so it was relatively easy to saw through. I sanded down the shelves, which only had a few chunks out of them, and once they were painted they would look fine. These shelves were very practical. They didn\'92t have to look beautiful.\

 \
I went for a walk with Hamish. He was a choreographer and lately a photographer and we\'92d made some work together over the years. He was doing the London Loop so I joined him on a section in south east London.\
We got the train out from Lewisham and started walking. It was raining quite badly but I hadn\'92t brought a waterproof jacket. We walked for a while, following the London loop signs, but eventually Hamish realised we were going the wrong way. We set off again and got ourselves on the right track. We talked about his funding application for a PhD. Then we talked about an application for a festival we thought we might be able to do. We talked about handshakes and touch and how we might be able to make some kind of experience or performance about gestures of greeting.\
I told him about being aggressively questioned by the trans woman artist. I told him how ashamed I\'92d felt, and how panicked I\'92d been by being attacked. I said I realised that it must have been the feeling that people who got cancelled felt. Luckily for me, I didn\'92t want to get a slot on GB news, I said, so I didn\'92t need to be cancelled, so instead, I told my choreographer friend, I had sat with the shame and panic and tried to let it cool off, instead of responding to it by trying to denounce the artist who had denounced me. Obviously, I told the choreographer artist, all of this took place in my head.\
I kind of wanted him to placate me, but also not to just take my side. I didn\'92t know what I wanted. I just wanted to talk to someone about it. We talked it out. He was a good person to talk to. He was like me - a white guy who didn\'92t want to be a dick. He was involved in more delicate stuff though. He made work about BDSM and kink. He said that when he\'92d applied to something, an acquaintance he knew on the panel had said there was a general suspicion around straight guys who made work about bondage. He said that had hurt him, because he\'92d always tried to be so careful and think hard about the ethics of what he did. He said that once he\'92d put an Instagram story up of him making the OK sign with his thumb and forefinger and someone had gotten in touch telling him that it wasn\'92t ok to put up an alt-right signal, and that he was encouraging white supremacy. He hadn\'92t been thinking of that, he said, he\'92d been thinking of the circle game people played at school, where if someone made that sign and you looked at it, they could punch you in the arm. He said he\'92d taken his time to respond, but eventually he\'92d said he was sorry that she had been offended, and the person had said that wasn\'92t good enough, which, he said to me, he realised was a good point - that kind of apology was the worst kind. He\'92d thought about re-posting it with an explanation and a description of the alt-right appropriation of the symbol, but eventually, he\'92d just taken the post down.\
We talked about art and what it was for. I said I wasn\'92t interested in art being committed to a certain political cause, but that I didn\'92t mind if other people did believe in that. The problem was, that when people did believe in committed art, they did mind other people not making art that was committed to a political cause. So, even though the artist hadn\'92t actually seen my work, I kind of knew that she would hate it if she saw it, so I didn\'92t necessarily want to encourage her to watch it.\
We got to Petts Wood around 2:30. The walk had taken us about 3 hours. My legs and hip hurt. We sat and waited for the train, then sat on the train back to Lewisham talking about perversion - he had started reading a book about a Victorian middle class man who had been in love with a working class woman. He had been obsessed with her working, and had taken many photos of her with dirty hands and feet, including sometimes making her rub soot on her skin so she looked like a chimney sweep, though to us, now, looking at the pictures, it looked more like blackface. What was interesting was that he always wanted to marry the woman, but she didn\'92t want to, and they only lived together for a few years. My choreography friend had said that he thought it was fascinating that these people managed to indulge some kind of mutual (or at least consensual) kink, but before the notion of kink - or even of subculture more generally - had existed.\

I had supervision Dan at 10. I had sent him a new version of the abstract with a totally different focus - thinking about the PhD as being about direct address - or when artworks talk to the audience. It had obviously kind of unlocked something in his head about the PhD because he had some good suggestions for artists to look at. I was glad I\'92d managed to crack it.\
After the meeting I tried to work on my talk for the BA students at Kingston but I found myself failing to conjure the required enthusiasm. I went into the bedroom to see if my wife wanted to have lunch and luckily she was hungry so we ate before 1pm.\
I made coffee and told my wife I was going to do my presentation in the afternoon. I shut my door, kind of locking myself in the room with the presentation. But I found myself finishing my coffee and not having got anywhere with the presentation. I decided to go for a walk, and then, as I got ready to go, decided to go to the studio.\
I kissed my wife and left the house. I walked down towards Lewisham, listening to a podcast. I walked up around the station, then back towards the studio. I had a very small idea, which was that the opposite of talking to the audience in an artwork was something like abstract painting, which refused language, or free jazz, which refused the easy listening of an audience. It wasn\'92t a great idea, but it was something.\
My studio mate was in which was a nice surprise. We had a little chat - she was looking for a job because her and her boyfriend wanted to get a mortgage. She had a skype meeting so I put my headphones in and did some drawing. The drawings were all shit and I felt completely drained and angry and myself. I carried on drawing, occasionally thinking about the idea and making a note on a kind of shit graph with \'91not saying anything\'92 at one end and \'91talking to the audience\'92 at the other end. I realised that talking to the audience involved talking, but also acknowledging the presence of the audience, and the work I liked broadly fell at that end of both scales.\

 \
I painted the final coat on the shelves after breakfast, then we got ready and went to our 12 week scan. I had to wait outside with the dads. Everyone stayed on their phones. I read Sianne Ngai\'92s text on anxiety.\
  The scan was great - it was like watching an art video but the art was your own child. All the child\'92s bits were in the right place and the right size. We weren\'92t having twins. I felt a flutter of love for my child when I saw it move its arms. The sonographer poked at the foetus to make it move so she could check that it had a stomach, a brain, two arms, two feet etc. When she spotted something she would pause the video, then run it back and forth until she found a good image, then write the body part she was looking for onto the image on her computer and save it.\
  I went to pay for our token so we could get our image from the scan but the machine didn\'92t take coins, even though we had specifically bought coins because the letter had specified to bring change, which both me and my wife had felt implied coins rather than paper money. Luckily, a pregnant woman in the waiting room said she would swap a note for some coins. We got our scan pictures, then my wife had a blood test to check for Down\'92s Syndrome while I waited outside in the sun. It was a warm sunny day.\
We walked back through the park, happy and feeling grateful that our baby was ok and that we had seen it. My wife was actually 13 weeks pregnant, and our due date was a week earlier - 22nd September.\
At home I took a good picture of the scan image. My wife ate a boiled egg and went to work. I spent the morning and early afternoon assembling the white noise radio show. It was really good and I was happy with it. Then I spent the remainder of the afternoon finishing an Arts Council application and sending it off. The director of the Hampstead project space never got back to me with the actual budgets for our planned exhibition so I just had to make it up.\
 \
Tuesday 23rd March\
 \
I ran for the first time in a few weeks and it gave me a good feeling of power and ability and I felt free to work and make. I spent the morning reading out my Kingston talk for BA students. It was ok, I\'92d come back to it again, I thought. \
I had a coffee, and then I did some admin, looked at a job I wanted to apply for, and finished my ACE application and sent it off.\
At 2pm I had a Zoom with Ben Jeans Houghton, an old friend from university. We chatted for two hours. He told me about his PhD proposal, all about magical systems and the power they had. He kept kind of slipping into this thing where he told me basically that magic could change the world, but was always a bit embarrassed about it, because we had different views on magic as magic vs magic as a system of performative language. We talked about his funding application. He would hear back soon, but he wasn\'92t confident. I told him that my wife was pregnant and he was really happy for us. He said he\'92d be happy to be my son and we laughed.\
In the evening I watched a talk by Owen Parry at Goldsmiths Performance Research Forum. I thought it would be a small group with some scary people - like hardcore political artists who would see me and go in for the kill somehow. But really, it was 50 people with their cameras off, watching a talk. It was good, all about trash and Ryan Trecartin. It wasn\'92t a very complex paper, and it made me think that I could do that sort of thing easily, which made me feel better about my writing.\
 \
Monday 5th April 2021\
 \
We drove home to London in the afternoon. I was tired and I had a headache. We got back and unpacked our stuff. Just as I was sitting down to play my guitar in the living room, our upstairs neighbour knocked on the door. She said she was moving out some more stuff and needed a hand with moving a chair. I told my wife what I was doing and she said to take a mask and be careful of bed bugs.\
It wasn\'92t a chair, it was two large, three seater reclining sofas. My upstairs neighbour had someone there who she referred to at first as her sister, then as her cousin. She was nice, and quite practical and strong, and we managed, with my neighbours help to get the first sofa out and down the four flights of stairs from the second floor to the ground, then out and to the van. I asked if the van driver could help but my upstairs neighbour said he had a bad back. The second sofa was even bigger. I had to swap places with the upstairs neighbours cousin or sister and we embed up maneuvering the sofa up and over the outside walkway handrail in order to swing it back out of the house. The four kids ran around us, with the little girl particularly interested. I told her she was doing a very good job of motivating us. We got the sofa down the stairs very slowly. On the last flight of stairs the van driver came and stood with me as I hauled the sofa down, it was a little bit late to help, I thought, but I let him carry on.\
We got the sofa into the van, and I said goodbye to my neighbour and wished her luck. She said she would be back. She said she needed to get the fridge out.\
I went back inside. My wife made me take all of my clothes off downstairs and put them in the washing machine, then I went naked upstairs and had a shower.\
I made us stir fry for dinner and my wife asked me if I was worried that our neighbour would come back and ask us for help. I said I didn\'92t really mind.\
She did come back round. I put on some dirty clothes - not the ones in the washing machine, but different ones, then went upstairs. Me and her next door neighbour brought down a freezer, then the greasy dirty gas cooker, which my next door neighbour - who was luckily a trained plumber - had unhooked from the gas. Then we had to take down the washing machine, but my upstairs neighbour had not emptied her washing out of it, so it had by my guess about half a ton of water in there. It was incredibly heavy. I had to rely on another neighbour - a nice, quite stoic guy - to do most of the work. As we hauled stuff down the stairs and into the van I asked him about the previous tenants. He said that before my upstairs neighbour there had been a nice girl with a drug problem. Before her a guy who raised chinchillas and sold them for their fur. He\'92d had over 100 in the flat. Before him a guy who grew dope and kept having people come round the flat and attack him. He had been a nightmare, the neighbour said. I shivered internally and decided not to tell my wife about these previous tenants - we knew about the person growing weed, but not the drug addict or the chinchilla breeder. I hoped we just got a regular person with a kid who wasn\'92t on drugs or growing or selling drugs or breeding any kind of animal.\
We took the fridge freezer down. That was the last thing. I said good luck and then my upstairs neighbour basically asked me to come to her new house and get them all in the house. Her neighbour was waiting there, and he\'92d obviously already agreed. I desperately didn\'92t want to go, but there was no way out. If I didn\'92t go, there was no one else to help. Her cousin/sister was upstairs with the kids. The driver wouldn\'92t help because he had a bad back. I went inside my place and got my phone and a jumper.\
We drove to her new place It was dark and the drive took a while. I kept the window rolled down. My upstairs neighbour sat beside me and her neighbour went in the back of the van without any prompting.\
  We got there and loaded the dirty white goods in. There was no space in the new place because my upstairs neighbours' stuff was downstairs in the living room and kitchen, and we had to put all the stuff in the kitchen, which filled up any remaining space. It was a mess. It occurred to me that she had literally taken her mess and moved it to another place. I was tired and my back hurt. My upstairs neighbour was proud of her new place and wanted me to have a look around. Me and her neighbour walked around the house. It was much bigger - 4 bedrooms instead of two, and two bathrooms with an extra toilet as well. I was happy for her. As we went around the house her neighbour told me that he was coming back on Tuesday to put the kids\'92 beds together and cut some holes in the kitchen cupboards for the washing machine.\
We drove home around 9pm. My upstairs neighbour told me the name of her new street and said me and my wife should come and visit. As we got close to home she said that she had some jollof rice and chicken and that me and my wife should have some. I said it was kind of her but that we had eaten and it was late. She turned to the driver and quietly asked him if he was going to be late for work and he tried to reassure her that it was ok.\
I got home and had another shower. I told my wife about what had happened. It was unnerving, I said. Because her neighbour was doing all this stuff for her, and it was partly because he was a nice guy, but it was also mostly that literally no one else could help her, and that she had very few friends, and not much of a support network and no money. It was scary, all around her, and underneath her and behind her was chaos, and in front of her was the unknown but it probably held chaos too.\

 \
I started working on my gesture film, the second part of my series about power. I wasn\'92t filming until the next week, but I thought I could get going with things, writing, finding archive material, doing bits of editing, VFX and sound work.\
  I did some writing in the morning, and edited a nice piece of Groucho MArx footage with some ambient music I\'92d made. It was a monologue from Duck Soup - almost a soliloquy - about handshakes. In the clip, Groucho is the prime minister of Freelandia, and after having almost caused a diplomatic incident with another country, the governess arranges a meeting between him and the ambassador of the country. At first, Groucho is positive about the situation, saying that he will extend the right hand of peace to the ambassador, but then he gets worried that the ambassador will refuse to shake his hand. He works himself up into a fit of resentment at his potential humiliation, and, when the ambassador finally arrives, instead of shaking his hand, he slaps him in the face with a pair of gloves, which causes the ambassador to declare war on Freelandia.\
 \
Friday 16th April 2021\
 \
I spoke to my second supervisor Volker. We talked about the texts I\'92d sent. He hadn\'92t been able to read them in full, but we talked about the general themes. He returned to his favourite theme that the fine art PhD had to find its own form, and that its knowledge couldn\'92t necessarily take place in language. I knew this was his favourite topic, but felt a little like he was telling me off for having written some essays. It was hard. I did want to do a fine art PhD, but I also wanted to write in a formal way sometimes, and I didn\'92t see why they should be mutually exclusive practices. He was saying that artists produced knowledge that was suspicious of rational, linguistic forms of knowledge.\
We spoke about direct address. He remembered something he\'92d read about Goethe, how one of his novels was address to women in general, and one reader had thought that he was addressing her directly and written back to him, and ended up writing reams and reams to him, and people had though that she was a mad woman but of course she was correct to respond to him. She\'92d seen through the form. I said that I didn\'92t like the implication that there was some kind of falsehood in forms and conventions. They weren\'92t less real than anything else and there wasn\'92t any reality behind them to be revealed. And, her response to Goethe - a very brilliant and subversive response, wouldn\'92t have been so brilliant and subversive - in fact, wouldn\'92t have been possible at all, if most of the audience for his novels hadn\'92t implicitly understood the conventions of the form he\'92d used.\

All night I dreamt abstract, tiring dreams about a sentence that wouldn\'92t be edited into a satisfying phrase.\

Thursday 13th May\
 \
I showered and got ready, then went to meet an ex-goldsmiths artist who had tweeted about needing some USB audio players. I had some that I\'92d used for some installations in the past and said I could meet him. We met up, had a coffee and chatted for a while. It was nice to see them. They\'92d changed their pronouns in the last few years and now went by they rather than he. I was worried that I would somehow offend them, though of course, because we were standing and talking together, there was no real opportunity to use the wrong pronoun at all, because of course, I just said you, if I referred to them at all. I did keep saying man, as in \'91oh man that\'92s so bad\'92, but unfortunately, I was the sort of person who said oh man to women as well as men, which was just an embarrassing conversation tic rather than any kind of gendering device. It was nice to catch up with them. They told me they had broken up with their wife and had been going through a tough time and we talked about breakups and the fall out of break ups. We spoke about their job at the university library and about their upcoming shows. I wished them luck and told them I\'92d come to see the London shows and said they should come on the podcast which they didn\'92t say yes or no to but I was sure they would. We said goodbye and I went home for lunch.\
\
Wednesday 19th May 2021\
 \
There was a long, quite boring CARC seminar. The first person presenting was ok. Though he played some recorded writing which was quite boring, and then showed some work that seemed entirely unrelated. I realised that neither of the people presenting had come to see my presentation and I semi thought fuck you to both of them, but the first person presenting did say that they were working full time and had just had a baby so I gave them a mental pass.\
	Back at home I got a decision letter from the Arts Council. I logged into the Grantium portal and saw a document called offer acknowledgement which gave me an inkling that I\'92d got the money. I opened it and realised that I\'92d got the grant. I was very happy. It meant I would be able to make some new performance work with Daniel and Tammy.\
 \
Tuesday 25th May 2021\
 \
I had a zoom meeting with Daniel and Tammy about the Arts Council funded project. We managed to find some dates for workshopping and filming the performance. I was glad we\'92d found dates because my performer had kids and other commitments and I had lots of things on in June.\
After my meeting I spoke to my wife and realised that I\'92d booked the filming days over some days when my wife had booked some holiday so we could spend time in Suffolk having a little holiday together. She understood that I had to do the work but was quite angry. We spent the rest of the afternoon with her in a bad mood, though she was fairly reasonable. She was sad that we wouldn\'92t have had a proper holiday before we had our baby. I would still get to go out and see my friends, she said, but she would be stuck at home with the baby.\
We had a walk around the park and found some other dates when we might be able to have a little holiday and I felt a bit better about it.\
At home I made notes from an essay by Hito Steyerl called Is the Museum a Factory, then had a beer, made dinner and wrote my diary.\
\
Tuesday 8th June 2021\
 \
I had my vaccination in the morning. It took me a while to find the right vaccination tent at Guy\'92s hospital, but when I did, I got my jab within a few minutes. Then I waited 15 minutes, looking at my phone and feeling excited about having been vaccinated, and that in some way it - this, this whole thing was \'91over\'92. I hoped anyway. I felt like maybe I could even stop doing my diary. Or, if it had been a publishable thing, rather than a huge mass of banal diary entries, then maybe this jab would be the end of the book.\
Before I went to sleep I took some paracetamol as people advised when you\'92d had the vaccine. In the night I woke up because the pain in my arm and shoulder was bad. I went to the toilet, then came back to bed. We were both woken up by a very loud motorbike driving past the house, which then set off a car alarm. I tried to get back to sleep but started to feel a bit panicky about the vaccine, about the pain in my arm, and about blood clots, even though I knew that the Pfizer vaccine wasn\'92t associated with blood clots. I got up, telling my wife that I thought I might go and sit somewhere to calm down, but then I felt a bit dizzy, and told my wife that I felt like I might faint. I lay back down on the bed.\
	Then I was in hell, and there was an endless waterfall of words, text, speech, running through me and I couldn\'92t hold onto any of it. It was the worst feeling a person could have. It felt so bad. It was a pain that you would do anything to avoid.\
Eventually, I came to and I saw my wife and I said I was ok. She told me I\'92d fainted and that my eyes had been open and that it had been so weird and scary. She opened the window and turned the light on and I just felt happy that I was in my own bed, lying down looking at my wife and not in hell anymore. It was hard to explain to her. I knew it was scary for her when I fainted because I went grey and my eyes stayed open and it was like a seizure, really.\
After a while I said maybe I should have some toast and some water. My wife made me some toast, I ate it, drank some water, then we went back to sleep.\

Friday 11th June 2021\
 \
I got a train to Waterloo from where I walked to the Hayward Gallery to see the Matthew Barney exhibition.\
The security guard told me that really I should have the NHS Test and Trace app on my phone but I had resisted getting it for this long, so it seemed pointless to download it now. Instead, I filled in my details on an iPad and went in.\
I had planned to maybe only watch half of the two hour Barney film, thinking that I would want to see the rest of the show, but in the end I stayed for the whole thing. There was something about boredom as a part of the experience that I was fascinated by, or a non-pleasureful or non-pleasure focused attention. The work was grand in scale. He\'92d got a drone and taken big sweeping shots of the snowy landscape of Idaho. It occurred to me that Barney always individualised huge forces. In this film, individual freedom which was equal to violence which was equal to power which was equal to life and also death was personified in the character of the hunter, but the kind of dualistic life/death thing was also personified in two dancers who seemed either part of the hunter character, or like a chorus whose job was to be with the hunter. And state authority, or violence was personified in Barney\'92s character, a National Parks ranger who followed the hunter and made engravings. But in the end, these big into small themes into character descriptions of the film dissipated into a more literal engagement with whatever was on screen at any one moment. There was a story, but it was subservient to moments or events. It was film, but the moving image was subservient to individual images, constructed in the act of filming. It was about what the characters represented, but that was subservient to what the individual performers did - or almost more like demonstrations of what they could do, their capacities for doing certain things. The quality of line demonstrated in Barney\'92s engravings, or the strength and skill of the dancers.\

 \
I got up and decided to go to Bell Green Retail Park to film the birds by Mcdonalds and near Sainsburys. I went out fairly early and cycled through Ladywell fields and Catford, down the river to Sydenham.\
  I used my phone to film the birds in Sainsbury's car park. I got some good shots. I rode around, filming the crows bouncing and bobbing away from me. Then I filmed at the Mcdonalds. It was getting busier as the morning wore on. I went in and ordered a milkshake. I realised I should have ordered some chips to feed the birds. I filmed cars surrounded by birds from my table outside. Eventually I finished up and rode back to Lewisham.\
  At home I used my new video editing programme to put all my footage together into a rough edit. I learned how to stabilise the footage and do motion tracking. It worked so much faster than the Adobe software I was used to using. Once I had a rough edit, I recorded an improvised voiceover, addressed to my scouser friend who I\'92d been telling about the birds, then uploaded it to Youtube and sent her the link.\
  After lunch I started sanding down the front door, then washed it, then started painting. When my wife got back I was sitting with the painted door propped open to dry. It took ages to dry and even when we decided to close it, it was still a bit sticky.\
  In the evening we went to Ladywell and bought pizza, then went to the park and sat and ate it in the sun.\
 \

 \
I went for a swim. Afterwards, when I had a shower I dropped my boxer shorts on the wet floor for a second, so when I put them on they were a bit damp. I put on the rest of my clothes and walked to the station to get the DLR to Deptford. I walked up to the coffee shop where I was meeting Claire Undy, who ran the online project that I was going to make some work for and we had a meeting in the sun, talking about the project, but also about being an artist parent, about teaching and about doing a PhD.\
I left her and went home, and almost immediately felt a bit annoyed, as though I knew I wouldn\'92t achieve very much that day. I did a bit of emailing, then we had lunch and then I did a second coat of paint on the door. The paint didn\'92t go on very well, and it didn\'92t look very good when I finished. Then, I had to sit in the living room for the rest of the afternoon because I had to leave the front door open. I spent the afternoon making different research portfolios for the different jobs I was applying to. I kept checking the door and it kept not being dry.\
 \
Thursday 17th June 2021\

The weather had turned. It was raining hard when we woke up. We got up and went for a swim. After about 30 mins I asked my wife how she was doing and she said she was kind of finished. She still felt like she hadn\'92t felt the baby kick very much and it was making her feel distracted, I said we should go home and call the midwives and then go to the hospital if we needed to.\
  At home I got ready and my wife phoned the midwives. They told us to go to the hospital and get it checked. On the walk there we were quiet, both separately worrying about what would happen if the baby was dead. Even saying our biggest fear out loud was hard.\
  We went up to the day assessment unit and I waited outside while my wife went in. I sat on my phone. I messaged my local friend who had invited us round for dinner on Saturday night. He\'92d asked what my wife couldn\'92t eat because of pregnancy so I told him. Then I told him that we were at the hospital for a checkup because my wife couldn\'92t feel the baby. But then my wife messaged and said that everything was fine and they\'92d checked the baby\'92s heartbeat and it was all good.\
We walked back home from the hospital and we were very relieved that the baby was ok. I spent the rest of the day neatening up some notes for the meeting I was having the next day with my performer and the performer with dwarfism who I was meeting for the first time.\
In the afternoon I recorded some backing vocals for the band. It was hard to do some of them because they were quite high so I had to sing quite loud but I was self conscious because of the neighbours. I recorded them as best I could.\
In the afternoon I checked my Chelsea email and saw a message from a student asking me to help her present a charity auction that her and the rest of the graduate diploma course were putting on as part of their final exhibition. I agreed, as my wife had said she was going out for lunch. I thought maybe I could wear my green screen suit and an Elon Musk mask that I had at the studio.\

 \
I went for a meeting with my performer Daniel, and the performer with dwarfism, Tammy about the arts council funded performance to camera I had asked them to work on. I hadn\'92t met Tammy before but they were really nice. I talked through the script I had written over the last year, explaining what the ideas were, and how I might want to work on them. I tried to explain the overall vision for the project, and how the work might look at the end. I talked about how they would be in hell, and on an artist\'92s residency, and filming a performance. How they would be themselves, and also any character they felt like playing. And I talked about how I wanted to shoot it. Single takes, then iterations of the same performance over and over again.\
It got to 1pm and we had kind of finished, so instead of having lunch we just called it a day. Tammy ordered a taxi and we waited and chatted. I felt like they would be easy to work with.\
I walked home in the drizzle. At home I ate pasta and rested for a while. It rained hard all afternoon. I made a new version of the shooting script based on the notes I\'92d made in the meeting.\
 \
Saturday 19th June 2021\
 \
It turned out my wife wasn\'92t going for lunch with her friends. One of them was pregnant and had got worried about the Delta variant of the Coronavirus so they cancelled. If I\'92d known that they weren\'92t going for lunch I wouldn\'92t have said yes to doing the auction thing for the Chelsea students but I\'92d committed so I left the house around 12. I went to the studio and picked up my green screen suit and the Elon Musk mask and some cable ties, then got the train to Victoria.\
At Chelsea I chickened out of putting the green screen suit on because I was worried the audience would see my penis through the suit. Instead, I just wore the Elon Musk mask and stood next to the student who did the auction, occasionally singing or making stupid comments about the art. It was cringey and I was only occasionally witty enough to make anyone laugh. However, I wasn\'92t too self conscious because I was wearing a mask. I bid on some of the works but never won any. In the end, the students made \'a31488 so I just donated \'a312 to get them up to \'a31500. When we finished I chatted to the course leader for a bit and then left. I wondered if she had lost respect for me.\
On the way back to Victoria I started to feel a lot of shame and embarrassment, as though wearing the Elon Musk mask and making cringey jokes might have ruined my chance of getting a permanent job at Chelsea. I had applied for lots of jobs, and I worried that some people in the audience were people who would have some power over whether I got an interview and they had found my presence distasteful and cheap and thought of me as an idiot and desperate for attention.\
At Victoria I went to M&S and bought a can of strong IPA to drink on the train to quell my rising sense of shame. The beer helped, and on the train I relaxed a bit.\

 \
I got up and had an easy breakfast. Then I went down to the studio and constructed some funny tripod stands out of bamboo. They were purposefully shitty bits of work and their only job was to hold a coloured plastic ball in the air so that we could use them in the performance to camera as stand ins for imagined objects, I would then use the coloured balls as image tracking points when I did the VFX in the edit.\
I couldn\'92t shake a kind of grey anxiety. I\'92d been drinking since the weekend so I put it down to that.\
Back at home I made coffee and worked on my computer. I made the images I had to print for the performance to camera - manipulated images of the performers\'92 faces on shoes, dog poos, and some other objects that felt like they had a relation to low or high status, then just some images of different animals on white background. I realised that the only way I could print them was to go to university the next day. That was going to make the next day very busy and not very fun as I would have to go Kingsotn, then come back to Lewisham, then back to Waterloo for a reading group at 2pm.\
My wife got home and we chatted for a while, then had some dinner that she\'92d brought home from work. They were having a training week and today was a bring and share day where they all brought food. My wife had taken a pavlova and people had loved it. It was funny how many pavlovas she had made in the past few weeks.\
  We ate her colleague\'92s dad\'92s homemade chana chaat, then washed up. The sun came out after a very grey day and I sat and wrote my diary while my wife rested. It was exactly three months until our baby was due.\
 \
Wednesday 23rd June 2021\
 \
I went for an early swim then went straight to the station. I got the train to Waterloo east and then to Surbiton. From there, I walked to Kingston and printed off some pictures I needed for the rehearsals for the next few days. I printed off lots of pictures of different animals which I needed for a bit where I would ask the performers how much they respected the different animals when I held them at different heights. I also printed off lots of images of the performers' faces on different things: dirty shoes, dogs, shit, stamps, Big Ben.\
I felt very good because of the swim. Peaceful and calm and in control. I marvelled at this feeling because I knew that the next day I would feel bad and weird because of working with performers which always made me anxious and tired and depressed.\
I travelled back to Lewisham on the train, popping into my studio on the way home to pick up my camera tripod. At home I had a shower and got ready, then had lunch, and then left for the reading group, getting back on the train to Waterloo East, but this time instead of getting a train from Waterloo, walking from Waterloo East to the South Bank to meet my PhD colleagues at a bar near the National Theatre.\
We sat and talked about the papers we had read. I drank a lime and soda, then a pint. At one point I said something about how research might have a tone which might not be mentioned in the research itself - we were talking about the idea of artwork which takes on other forms as parody, or satirically, and how this in itself might not be the focus of the research, but the Scottish PhD student suddenly asked if all of this wasn\'92t just a bit of artwank. I must have given him a look of contempt and spat the word back at him. I said we were a group of art PhD students discussing two long papers about artistic research. I said we were a bit beyond worrying about self-indulgence. I couldn\'92t believe someone was accusing someone else of pretentiousness in a situation which was part of a formal process in which we acknowledged and made official our belief that art was important, and serious and worth devoting our lives to. The irony was that the Scottish PhD student was doing the PhD part time, so he\'92d been doing it for five years. It would be a great hurdle to completing the PhD to be worrying all the time about whether or not it was a bit pretentious to talk about art.\
	The artist leading the research group moved us all on but I felt a bit like I\'92d shown my cards or maybe expressed a bit too much of an opinion.\
By the time I left to get the bus to Hackney I\'92d drunk two and a half pints - though the second pint and the half had been very low alcohol beer. Either way I was a bit pissed and enjoyed my bus journey through Clerkenwell and Old Street and up to Dalston. I walked to Newington Green where my wife met me with another beer and some crisps. We sat on the grass and chatted and occasionally watched a very high and drunk man make his way through the park, trying to talk to a few people sitting on their own. We also watched the dog people in the corner, who presumably came to the park with their dogs everyday and hung out. It was an odd bunch and we wondered if there were some local dog owners who tried to avoid the dog people. Maybe they came at different times, or just avoided looking over to the corner where the friendly but strange dog people were.\
My photographer friend and his music booker partner arrived. We went to the restaurant and sat down. The music was loud and the waitresses were all wearing masks so it was hard to hear them speak. We ordered some wine which turned out to be organic wine which was ok but not the best. We ordered lots of plates to share - bread, a salad of broad beans and mozzarella, some pasta dishes and some roast pork.\
We talked about our pregnancy, about work and about their holiday to Scotland. They\'92d been staying in a bothy and one night a weird guy had arrived quite late and stayed there too. They stayed up late with him and he talked about rape and about authoritarianism, how it was a simple process where first the government asked you to do something, then they told you to do it, then they killed you. He kept giving them examples of the ask, tell, kill strategy. Our friends said they had both been worried that eventually he would try and get them to act out his idea, asking them to do something, then telling them to do something, then killing them if they didn\'92t do it.\
We spoke about vaccines and they surprised me by saying they weren\'92t going to have it. Or at least they weren\'92t going to have it yet. But then later, they slowly kind of mentioned that they might be trying for a baby which was also surprising, but made sense as to why they might not be having the vaccine as there were various conflicting views on whether it might have an effect on people trying to conceive.\
We left just before 10. They got their bikes and rode off and me and my wife walked back to Dalston to get the train home. It was nice to be walking in east London and to have had a nice evening. It felt very carefree. We knew we wouldn\'92t be able to do this many more times before we had a baby to look after.\
\
Rehearsals\
 \
Thursday 24th June 2021\
 \
As always when I had to work with performers I felt a knot of tension and depression in my stomach when I woke up. I found the whole process of being in charge of people, employing people and possibly wasting their time, very hard. Particularly when I was often underprepared, and also having to work through ideas with people in the room, and the people were the ideas and the ideas were the people. It was hard to tell people what to do, but also to know what I wanted them to do, exactly.\
I met Daniel and Tammy and we started working through all the bits on my printed out shooting script. Some of the performances I had to re-read a few times to remember exactly what they were meant to be getting at, and sometimes I read something, and then, looking up at the performers, realised that it wasn\'92t enough, and we just had to start performing it without it having any kind of parameters or rules or anything that helped us improvise through the idea.\
I was confused about my role as a director and as a performer - this confusion was partly built into the script, but also was a real confusion, reflecting my discomfort at my worry that I wasn\'92t a very good performer, and my discomfort at the directing part of being a director.\
At one point, Tammy was performing to camera and she asked me whether she should look at the camera, or at me, and I got into a long explanation about how she should be looking at the director, who was a kind of off camera presence who stood in for the audience, but could be referred to as the director and she laughed and said she would look at me.\
It was only a rehearsal - we were filming over three days in the next few weeks - and this made it even harder, because I was getting them to do things that were almost nothing: go up and down ladders, say the same sentence over and over again, but there wasn\'92t much point in making the performers do the things for the amount of time that I actually wanted them to do them for when we filmed, because even though I was filming on my phone, I probably wouldn\'92t use any of the footage. So occasionally we just didn\'92t do some of the things that I had written down because I felt so bad about asking the performers to do the things that I\'92d originally said that we\'92d do, even though I was paying them to do these things, and they were what they expected to be doing.\
At the end of the afternoon I knew that we had gotten somewhere with the work, but I still felt like a fraud and a liar, even though this was exactly what I had expected to be doing, and also, exactly the sort of feeling I\'92d expected to be feeling. Either way, I was glad when I was home.\
I drank a beer and edited some of the footage we\'92d shot, making a shoddy version of a few ideas so I could send them to the performers and they could grasp the mood of the piece.\
The bits I did looked good and I was happy with them. I sent them over to the performers and they liked them. Then I ate pasta and watched TV.\
 \
Friday 25th June 2021\
 \
I felt the same dread on the second day of rehearsals as I had on the first. Maybe if I performed more regularly, or did it for longer periods of time then I would get used to it and not feel so horrible but I only did it a little bit every now and again and for not very long and then felt awful and then forgot all about how bad it felt until I had to do it again.\
The second day passed in a similar manner to the first, in which I had to make decisions based on very little information about very small ideas. I wanted to be in charge, but also didn\'92t know what I really wanted and was trying to work it out as we went.\
I was glad that Tammy was nice and non-confrontational. If they had been challenging or less easy going I would have found it hard to work with them because I was always so uncertain about what we were doing.\
We finished up around 3:30 and I headed home with all of my props and kit in a big Ikea bag. I felt nervous and jumpy on the way home. That was always how all my negative feelings manifested: everything became fear. Every feeling ever had was subservient to fear, or the fear of being afraid at some point in the future.\
\
Filming\
\
 \
Monday 28th June 2021\
 \
I got up and got ready. I felt the hangover from my hangover - heartburn and a deeply bad feeling - a mixture of dread, anxiety and depression. Even though I felt all these feelings, since writing the monologue bits for the performance a few days earlier, I\'92d become quite certain that the filming would go well. I was definitely more certain on how to film things: more doing, less talking; more deadpan, less acting. So, even though I felt emotionally very fragile, I also knew that I trusted myself and the performers to make some good work.\
I put all my stuff in a wheely bag and walked down to meet Tammy. They were driving me and Daniel to Kingston where we were filming.\
Daniel arrived on his bike and Tammy waved at us from across the road. They kept their car at a friend\'92s house. As far as I could tell from Daniel and Tammy\'92s conversations, it was a big anti-squat full of live artists that they both knew. It was an old coroner\'92s office, and sometimes in the past, the live artists had opened up the mortuary and used it to stage live art events, though they weren\'92t meant to.\
We drove to Kingston, with me in the front seat navigating from Tammy\'92s phone. We chatted all the way - it was reassuring that we all got on quite well, so even if the artwork was shit, they would probably be nice about it.\
It took a while to get to Kingstong, but we parked up and had time for a coffee before we started filming.\
We got in the room and the performers were both impressed with the equipment - the big green screen curtain and flooring, the camera, the lights and the microphone. I was glad they were excited to see it. Daniel asked me to take a photo with them in the set up so he could show his wife.\
We got straight into filming. I decided to just go down the list of my shooting script, doing the most straightforward bits early on to give me a bit of confidence. I got them to run on the spot, lay on their backs and cycle their legs in the air, bounce up and down, and spin round and round. These were going to be \'91warm up\'92 sections, and They would play between 10-12 midday on the website and installation when the work was shown. The idea for the work was that there would be some time dependent elements. For example, from 7-10, 12-2, and 5-7 it would be \'91feeding time\'92, and the first video shown to people on the website would be my performers eating coleslaw or crisps or pepperamis or an apple and saying \'91this is neurodiversity!\'92 or \'91this is accessibility!\'92.\
The time whizzed by. We had lunch and talked about a live artist who was in the process of being cancelled. He was a creepy guy who had a bad reputation, and slowly, people were gathering evidence against him. I didn\'92t know him but the performers did. It seemed clear to me that he was a bad guy, but also, that there wasn\'92t a brilliant way to resolve the situation. It didn\'92t seem that there was any legal solution, in the sense that no one was accusing him of sexual assault or harrassment, but rather, that people didn\'92t want to be near him because he was a bit gross and creepy. It was interesting to hear about it, to hear about this process of organising and collecting information that would result only in a very messy kind of expulsion from a community. The sort of thing that could not be undone, but yet probably would never be resolved. This was a person who made their living from live art, and would probably not be convicted of any crime, so he would be fired, or blacklisted from various organisations, but might always find work. Perhaps he would always be defended by some sections of the community who found it hard to justify taking part in that process. It also seemed that there was no chance that the live artist would learn from their mistakes, or try to become a better person who was less creepy.\
We got back in the studio and I told my performers to stop talking about named people who had done terrible things so that we could start filming again. In the afternoon we shot more sections that were fairly straightforward,  but some of them did involve speaking some bits of script. At about 3:30 I got them to pretend to sleep and filmed lots of different shots of them laying on the floor. I would cut these together to make a sleep edit that would play overnight, from 10 or 11pm until 7 in the morning.\
We packed up and drove back to Ladywell. It took an hour and a half and we chatted all the way back. I was grateful to Tammy, but I was also glad to be walking home, on my own, with no responsibility apart from walking and carrying my bag. Directing was hard, and I always dreaded the responsibility of it.\
 \
Tuesday 29th June 2021\
 \
I spent the whole day working on my upgrade presentation. I wrote a kind of intro bit for it, just a kind of repetitive, colloquial rephrasing of the aims of my PhD research. Then, a kind of sudden reveal of reality, in which I talked about the weather, about swimming, about my neighbours making a banging noise upstairs, and about the fact that the text was written on Tuesday 29th of June, which would insert a bit of meta-commentary on the performance of the upgrade. The idea was that the examiners would be drawn into the words of the scripted bit, then be kind of jerked out of it by the change in tone of voice and writing style. Then I just dumped in my abstract, my methodology, and a description of a few bits of work I'd done.\
We had lunch, then I went back to the presentation. I started putting together bits of video to work with the script. I used a bit of video I\'92d shot the day before, with the performers sitting staring at the camera like a passive audience. I\'92d do the intro while that video played, then I\'92d switch to a video I made of my computer screen, with the text I was reading showing on the google documents tab. Then I put in some bits of video of my work, and some stills.\
My keynote file started getting really big and it was slow to add videos and stills. Just as I was finishing up, I realised that the file was on my external hard drive, so I moved it onto my desktop.\
The England vs Germany game started at 5pm, and my wife went out to meet some friends, so I sat on the sofa, did my diary and watched the game. I drank two beers and half watched it, then, when it was the second half I started making dinner. But then England scored and I was much more interested and then we scored again and I shouted and swore in the kitchen.\
I felt very happy that England beat Germany and the only way I could explain my interest was the fact that the Euro 1996 game where we lost to Germany was probably the last time I was really interested in football, and also a very early feeling of deep sadness that I remembered. The feeling of being disappointed, and very sad and surprised, and now, a different feeling about the same object. Though, obviously, it wasn\'92t the same object, in the sense that it wasn\'92t the 1996 game. But perhaps it was reparative in some way, allowing me to re-understand my 10 year old feeling of sadness as contingent, incidental, rather than necessary and inevitable.\
 \
Thursday 1st July 2021\
 \
I woke up and had breakfast. We went swimming. At first I couldn\'92t get a rhythm. It was busy andI kept having to slow down, or wait, or go ahead of a slow man. Eventually I found a good spot in the circuit and managed to do my lengths.\
At home I had a shower, shaved and got dressed. I practised the first bit of my upgrade presentation, made myself a cup of tea, and then logged onto Zoom.\
The examiner and the chair were academics from Kingston. The host was an architecture and design specialist and the examiner was a dance and performance scholar. They asked if my supervisor was coming and I said he wasn\'92t because we\'92d decided he wouldn\'92t attend but they looked a bit confused, saying that supervisors did normally attend.\
I gave my presentation, and then the examiner asked me some questions. Halfway through the questions my supervisor turned up. He apologised, saying that he\'92d had a calendar malfunction and I felt a bit bad, like I\'92d dumped him in it by saying that we\'92d agreed that he wouldn\'92t come. I wondered if he\'92d been emailed by one of them, reminding him that it was taking place.\
We finished up, and they informally let me know that I\'92d passed and they were happy with my project. The examiner said she had lots of notes to pass on and we agreed to meet up over summer and talk more about things.\
We finished up and I came downstairs and made a big cup of coffee. It felt like a Sports Direct mug kind of day. I told my wife that I\'92d passed my upgrade and we kissed. I folded the laundry and went upstairs with my coffee.\
My supervisor had emailed apologising for being late. I gave him a call and we chatted about the upgrade. He was happy. He said that after I\'92d left they\'92d had a chat and the examiner was really pleased with what I\'92d given them. We agreed to meet at the end of July and talk about the next year of the PhD.\
I started working on some of the performance to camera videos whilst also playing Wimbledon on a little browser window beside my video editing software. It took me about an hour to edit one clip.\
  At 1pm my wife came upstairs. She was hungry and wanted me to cook so I went downstairs and made broccoli pasta. We ate and chatted for a while. My wife felt tired. I said she should have a nap but she said she shouldn\'92t because she was meant to be at work.\
  I went upstairs and carried on editing videos. I also did some admin - updating the Radio Anti website with my local government friend\'92s nice photos of our installation at the gallery in Southwark. It was a pity that there were such clear reflections on the TVs, but it still looked good. I uploaded the podcasts too.\
  I worked until about 5, then did some music for the band. My wife ordered fish and chips, then when it arrived, she took it to the park to meet her local pregnancy group. I drank a can of cider and carried on working on the music. I did a full sketch of the song, but I didn\'92t feel inspired to carry on working on it so I finished up.\
  I watched Wimbledon for a while, then started cooking. I roasted some potatoes with lemon, cumin and mustard seeds, then heated up some dal and rice. I ate it in front of wimbledon. Then I decided to cut the grass and water the garden. We\'92d left the grass for ages and it had rained a lot so it was hard to cut. It took ages and hurt my back.\
  I cleaned up, then came back inside. I watched the last bits of the Wimbledon coverage, then washed up my stuff and turned on the big computer to watch Love Island. My wife got back and we sat on the sofa and watched Love Island. In the breaks she told me about her pregnancy group. One of the women was single and she needed somewhere to live. She was 7 months pregnant and her housemates had told her that she needed to move out once she had the baby. She said that sometimes she just cried. This morning, she told my wife, she'd woken up at 4am, taken the bus to London Bridge and walked along the South Bank. She told my wife that she\'92d laid on a bench and cried.\
 \
Friday 2nd July 2021\
 \
I went to the hygienist in the morning. I laid in the chair and the hygienist loomed over me, scraping, cleaning and polishing my teeth. For a while he was doing the suction with one hand while cleaning with the other, then an assistant burst through the door and apologised to the hygienist. She took up the suction and moved it around my mouth aggressively. It occasionally sucked at my cheek and tongue and got stuck and she had to pull it away to get it to work again. It was the sort of situation that could make me feel panicky, but at the same time it was quite relaxing. I worked a little to get into it as a relaxing situation and eventually did feel a kind of peace as they worked away at my mouth. Perhaps that was it, the way that they were doing the work and all I had to do was sit there. Was this a capitalist feeling? The pleasure of not being the one who worked. I supposed that pleasure was always there, perhaps it was given a particular slant by wage labour.\
I spent the rest of the day making a video for the performance to camera. I had some footage of the performers standing still but facing different ways i.e., first facing the camera, then right, then away from the camera, then left. I cut them up and animated them so that it was as though they were spinning around. I put bright colours behind the chroma keyed footage so the colour changed every time they changed direction. I sped up the edit over time, so at first they were slowly cutting front, right, back, left, front, right, etc. Then quicker, more rhythmic, then almost so fast that it was like stop frame animation of them spinning. I slowly came up with the idea that I would have a script of single words appearing over the top, in time with the cuts. I wrote the script, something about being selected for the residency/going to hell. Then I recorded the script as single words. I cut the voiceover up in time with the video, then also did subtitles to go over the top of the video. I pitched the vocals down so they were lower. I added some echo to the vocals and turned them up. It was nice but it didn\'92t sound very neat because the vocals overlapped as the cuts got faster.\
I found some percussive melodic samples and made a very basic melody that repeated through the cuts, getting faster. I realised that I could just get rid of the vocals and keep the text and the percussive melodic sounds.\
At the end of the video the script said \'91Welcome to hell\'92, and I googled how to make flaming text in my visual FX software and followed a youtube video to make the word, \'91Hell\'92, in flames.\
Then, I got some mellotron choir samples and layered and edited them to make a basic hellish sounding score for the outro with a flattened fifth chord (\'91the devil\'92s interval\'92). It worked ok but then I added west African percussion samples to the score and it sounded much better. I keyframed the last of the clips so that as the flaming hell title appeared, the performers dropped out of the screen. It just so happened that my performer had raised his hand at this moment in the clip so it looked as though he was starting to raise his hands up in the air as though he was scared. I wrote in my shooting script that I should shoot my performers waving their hands in the air and screaming.\
I spent most of the day making the video, then watched some Wimbledon in the afternoon before my wife got home.\
 \
 \
Tuesday 6th July 2021\
 \
We woke up slowly, had a cup of tea in bed. I made us breakfast and then I drove to Tescos to do the shopping. I didn\'92t often go to Tesco on a Tuesday and the checkout person was a young man with a learning disability, maybe autistic. He spent a long time listing all the Tesco Extras in south east London to the person in front of me. I said hello as I walked past him, but he didn\'92t greet me until he had started beeping through my items. He put my shopping through the scanner as fast as he could, so it piled up. Eventually, I was just putting things away while he waited, but he held a broccoli in his hand, and once I\'92d packed away everything else, he handed me the broccoli.\
Back home I put away the shopping and then we went swimming. It was nice to swim a bit later in the day, there were fewer people and I enjoyed the pace of the pool. My wife got stuck in the slow lane with a big gang of old people who swam four in a row and tried to talk to her.\
She went to town to buy some baby clothes and I headed home.\
I made a coffee and then wrote a monologue about shame for the performance to camera work. My wife came home and we ate broccoli pasta for lunch, then I had another coffee and edited a video of the performers waiting. I put three chroma keyed layers of them waiting around in front of the camera, then put lots of different images of waiting rooms behind them. Then I wrote some music using some samples of an autoharp. Then I added some cheesy 3D titles, and percussive sounds that synced with when the different clips popped into the edit. Finally, I added some quickly made up script about waiting as subtitles.\
My wife had a bad back again, so I got the birthing ball out and brought it downstairs for her to try and ease the pain by doing some stretches.\
Once I\'92d finished editing the video and rendered it I came downstairs, watched Wimbledon and wrote my diary. It rained heavily outside and it felt nice to be watching Wimbledon in the rain at home. My wife had a bath to try and ease her back and I put some rice on for dinner. \
 \
Wednesday 7th July 2021\
 \
I got up early and went to Kingston. I told my performers that I\'92d meet them there. I went to the library and picked up a book I\'92d reserved. I started to read in the library then realised I could go and get a coffee so I did that and read in the open study area by the reception.\
When my performers arrived we got another coffee and sat outside for a bit. We went up to the studios and the technician was still fiddling about. He was nice but it took ages for him to finish setting up the lights and the camera and then he said someone might come along at midday and look in the room because the building was up for some university design award. I said they should knock before they came in. When he left we laughed about how university production spaces were so strange. We could only use it from 11-1pm, then 2-4pm, so it was a four hour day, they were never ready on time, and then things like this - like we had to accept that some people would just pop in while we were trying to film, necessarily interrupting us, probably in the middle of a shot that we would then have to reshoot.\
We filmed some warming up performance - with Tammy and Daniel doing stretches, doing star jumps. We filmed me showing them pictures I\'92d made of their faces on shoes, dogs, poos and pretending that it was marketing material for hell/the fictional residency they were supposed to be on. We filmed me showing them pictures of animals at different heights and asking how much they respected each animal.\
We had lunch at the cafeteria but Daniel was on a weird diet so he had two boiled eggs, cured meat and some asparagus. Tammy had pizza and chips and I had omelette and chips and salad. Tammy was performing at a live event in Cambridge the next evening, and that evening Daniel was going to watch a live performance in Battersea. Both events had reduced capacity but it was interesting to know that live events were happening in the performance world again. Everything had been Zoom for so long.\
In the afternoon we did a long improvised conversation piece about shame, talking about our experience of shame. Tammy spoke about their experience of having dwarfism and being very visible to other people, and Daniel spoke about his dyspraxia and being obviously unable to do some things well enough to satisfy other people\'92s expectations.\
After that we finished with a performance where they repeated tautologies over and over and over again. First, \'91It is what it is\'92, then, \'91I am what I am\'92, then, \'91We made this performance ourselves\'92, then finally, \'91Life is for the living.\'92 All meaningless. But all true.\
We finished up. Daniel was waiting around  to go to Battersea so I told him I was going to sit and work for a bit if he wanted to wait with me. Tammy ordered a taxi and we sat outside and waited. I did a bit of work on my computer while they chatted, then she left to get her taxi. I tried to read for a bit, but then realised it was a bit rude to do so as my performer didn\'92t have a book or a computer to keep him occupied so we chatted, then walked together to the train station. He got off the train at Clapham Junction and I carried on to Waterloo then home.\

 \
We went for a swim in the morning. I felt quite tired but I did my lengths and we walked home saying how nice it was to go for a swim. My wife got tired walking up the hill and we had to stop halfway while she got her breath back and drank some water.\
I shaved, had a shower, then made coffee. I did some admin bits and then had a zoom with the filmmaker from my PhD. She had found a research project called Voices in the Gallery run by a researcher from Southampton Uni and thought I might be interested in making contact and maybe getting the researcher into Kingston to speak. We had a catch up, spoke about studios, covid, supervision, and the possibility of meeting people in person. The filmmaker said she would email the researcher and then we finished up the call.\
My wife was hungry so we had lunch early, and then I spent most of the afternoon transcribing the 30ish minute filmed conversation from the day before where me, Tammy and Daniel spoke about shame. I really enjoyed going back over our conversation and hearing what they had to say about shame. It was interesting to hear Tammy explaining their feelings about shame and visibility and the idea that they existed in the minds of other people as a funny anecdote. Tammy talked about falling over in public and then thinking to themselves that it was funny when a midget fell over, and that somehow, thinking this disobliged them from feeling any relationship to the embarrassment or shame they might feel if they fell over in private, when it would cause them to feel much more dissatisfaction with their body.\
It took a long time to get through the video. My technique was to play the video at about 30% speed, try to transcribe as it played, then stop the video when I lost track and go back over. There were lots of likes, and ums and ers and pauses and re-iterations of the same point but I liked the natural feeling of the conversation and the transcription.\
Once I\'92d finished that I did very slight editing on the end section where the performers and I chanted \'91shame\'92 at each other, then I tried to motion track the little orange ball on a stick that I had held while wearing the full green screen suit while filming. My plan was to track a picture of a dog poo or something that would appear as me in the conversation.\
I set up the motion tracker and then turned it on - it would take about 45 minutes to run through the whole clip so me and my wife went for a walk around the park. On our way back we bought some sweetcorn from the shop to make tuna mayo to have with jacket potatoes.\
At home I put the potatoes in the microwave, then went upstairs to check how the tracker was getting on. It had done maybe 5 minutes of tracking, then the little orange ball had gone off screen and the tracker had stopped. I googled, but there was no way of starting the tracker again at a later point. Eventually I figured out that I could split the VFX clip and start a new instance of the tracker. This worked a few times, but then it got to a section where I had started moving the orange ball around very quickly - kind of spinning it on the end of the stick, looping it around and around. At this point the tracker lost its place every few frames and eventually I realised that it would be too much work to do the whole thing in this way. I reset the whole clip and tried to track it again with a bigger area set for the tracker. That didn\'92t work. I removed the chroma key and tried it again with the orange set against the green. That didn\'92t work either. I realised that the tracking I\'92d done originally, before resetting it, had probably been as good as it would get. I was angry. It wasn\'92t going to work, and now I had this great conversation, but no way of putting a character into the clip instead of me. But, as I was dressed in a green screen suit, I would disappear into the background. What was, for some reason, most irritating, was that I knew that I could just put up a subtitle saying something funny about how I\'92d planned for the orange ball to be used for motion tracking but now it wouldn\'92t work so it looked shit. Not exactly that, but basically, recognising the issue within the work and making a kind of meta-joke about it. It annoyed me that there was this cheap solution to a problem that I couldn\'92t actually fix, and that I would end up doing the cheap solution.\

 \
We were meant to film at Kingston - it was the third and final day - but Daniel messaged early in the morning and said that he had to isolate because someone he knew had got coronavirus. He had tested negative but he still had to isolate for five days. I said no worries and said that I could probably still pay them for the day. We rearranged for a few weeks later and I ate my breakfast.\
I emailed the workshop at Kingston and told them I had to cancel and that I wanted to re-book. They said it was fine and that I should book a Teams meeting to re-book the room. It seemed a bit of overkill, but I booked an appointment for Monday at midday.\
In the morning I worked out how to do the motion tracking using a simpler, less sophisticated tool which was also much quicker to use. It was exactly as good/shitty looking as I needed it to be. It kind of mostly worked, then got confused sometimes and lost its place, but it meant that I could track an image of a dog poo on to my little orange ball and it did look like a kind of dodgy Instagram filter or automated FX and also looked like my performer and the performer with dwarfism were talking to a piece of shit.\
I started subtitling the video. It took me all afternoon to do about 15 minutes of the video, but it felt worthwhile. I felt like these videos of us talking about shame, and maybe power, and maybe the idea of normality, could be the central feature of the artwork. A kind of serious-non-serious discussion.\
 As I subtitled, what felt particularly interesting in regards to performativity was that when we spoke, we all constantly entered into citational speech - saying things in a way which involved pretending to quote an imaginary person; taking on a character or voice or position and then voicing that position, kind of citing them as an authority which was then either critiqued or used as a way to affirm what we were saying.\
My wife messaged me telling me it was flying ant day in Hackney where she worked. I told her it wasn\'92t flying ant day in South East London.\
I spoke to Claire who ran Skelf space. She\'92d commissioned the online work and was coding the webpage to host it. She was having trouble with the code needed to randomise the videos and cue them up at the right times. I emailed Rob Smith who I\'92d already asked to help me with coding a raspberry pi for the gallery version of the artwork and asked him if he minded giving her a bit of advice. She responded with the problem and he got back to her quickly with some tips. I\'92d felt a bit worried that it was a slight imposition to email him, but he was very nice about it.\
In the evening we had homemade pasta but my wife was very tired so I made the dough, then made very rustic looking orecchiette - ear shaped pasta - and a tomato sauce with a nice tin of tomatoes that we\'92d bought. It was tasty but the pasta was too bouncy and springy. I kind of preferred water and flour pasta rather than egg pasta, it tended to be chewy rather than springy.\
I drank some beers and messaged my performers telling them that I was really happy with what we\'92d filmed and that I thought the videos would end up being the heart of the artwork.\

 \
We got up and had a lazy morning - I changed the bedclothes and my wife put away a load of baby clothes in our chest of drawers.\
  In the afternoon we drove to Tankerton to meet my local government friend and his family. We had a lovely afternoon on the beach. We had a barbecue with sausages, chicken, potato salad, tomatoes, and some pasta that my friend had made. Then I put bananas with chocolate on the barbecue and left them there while we went into the sea. We hadn\'92t brought our swimming gear so we just paddled while my local government friend held his son\'92s hand as he bounced around in the cold, calm water.\
	We drove home, got back around 7:30. I got a beer and sat down to watch England get beaten by Italy in the final of the Euros. It felt sad but maybe correct that we lost on penalties. The feeling I had was very similar to the feeling I\'92d had in 1996, but maybe a little bit deeper, because now it was a feeling that things could be different, but weren\'92t. International football for me was now confirmed as a melancholy object. I was glad I hadn\'92t drunk a fourth can of beer. I felt bad for the footballers. They were very young to be doing something so public. I realised that sport was exciting for exactly that reason. My job, and most people\'92s jobs, didn\'92t ever require that kind of result under pressure. My job could be done in private, over a longer duration and not that many people cared if I was successful or not. But these young men \'96 children really 19, 20, early 20s \'96 people cared what they did in this 2 hour window. It mattered to the country.\

 \
I spent the whole day finishing the subtitling of the long conversation about shame for the performance to camera work. I did it in the front room, sat on my chair with my legs out on my wife\'92s birthing ball, watching the Wimbledon men\'92s final on the iPlayer. I knew the result and I was working so I only half watched it but it made me feel weird and a bit sad. They kept talking about the football final, which took place after the tennis finished. On the radio they kept talking about all the racist abuse given to the footballers. It was a grey, cloudy day.\
In the afternoon I downloaded videos of toilets flushing and edited it in behind the chroma keyed videos of us talking. I slowed the toilet videos down and zoomed in and cross faded them so they were constantly flushing behind us as we talked about shame.\
I rendered out a test render of the video but it kept failing so I had to google the problem and found a workaround. A VFX clip wasn\'92t rendering properly so I pre-rendered it in the cache and then clicked a button in the advanced render settings to use pre-rendered clips.\
In the night I woke up and couldn\'92t get back to sleep for a while. I was hot and a bit short of breath. I opened the window, took one sock off and tried to calm down and drink some water. Eventually I fell back asleep.\
 \
Tuesday 13th July 2021\
 \
We went swimming but my booking was later than my wife\'92s because I\'92d forgotten to book on the app in time. I arrived just as she was leaving and then I plopped into the second lane. Eventually I moved to the third lane because the second lane people were a bit slow. I swam for half an hour then left. On my way out of the pool I saw the guy who, months ago now, had backwards butterflied into me going the wrong way in the slow lane. He was doing exactly the same thing now, only no one had stopped him. Everyone else in the slow lane was a woman, so maybe they felt weird about approaching him. He definitely had a brain injury or a learning difficulty or something, but still, he was ruining everyone else\'92s swim.\
I spent the morning re-working the shame conversation video. I downloaded a high res image of a big living room with a TV on the wall and edited it it behind the chroma keyed video of us talking. Then I stretched and rescaled all the toilet flushing footage so it was roughly the same size and angle as the TV, and then put a mask over it in the shape of the TV screen, so it looked like it was playing on the TV. Then I found a tutorial on how to use VFX to make it look like the light was changing and did a very slow change in the light conditions of the living room picture over the course of the 30 minute video.\
I made a big thermos of coffee and drank it as I worked on another video of the performers wearing different wigs that Tammy had brought to the last filming day. Then, I started to look at some footage of me in a green screen suit, shuffling left and right across the frame, holding each of the wigs and kind of making them fly across the frame. My original plan had been to chroma key out me and the green screen, and make the wigs fly around, but actually now I realised that the untreated footage was much funnier - with me shuffling around in front of the camera in the ill fitting green screen suit, holding the wigs. I edited the clips together, then put a motion tracker on the videos that followed the wigs across the screen and wrote a little bit of text for each video - like a little meta commentary on what the video was, what it was meant to be doing, kind of from the point of view of a viewer watching it and wondering what was meant to be happening and maybe feeling a little disappointed - e.g. commenting on how the green screen suit bunched up around the crotch, but enjoying the music. The music I\'92d used was the intro to a Vashti Bunyan song that I\'92d been listening to - Vashti Bunyan had been really popular with some friends at university but I always found her a bit twee, but now I recognised how lush the sound of the music was.\
I had dal and rice and salad for lunch. I sat in the garden - the clouds had cleared and it was the first properly sunny day in a while. In the afternoon I worked on the video until it was finished, then rendered it out and uploaded it.\
I sat downstairs and read part of Elizabeth Price\'92s PhD from 1999. It was a kind of over the top deep analysis of the making of one of her sculptural works which was a big sphere or boulder made of packing tape. The text was a 24 page description of making the work - how the object and the making process changed over time; how the materials changed when they became part of the artwork; how the artwork had its own properties, which were related to, but different from the properties of the material. It was kind of an extended methodology, also kind of a parable or allegory about the ontology of an artwork - any artwork. Also, it was kind of a satire or slight parody of the dryness of research at the same time as being a very real piece of research in art.\
The artwork itself was, perhaps, incidental to the text, serving as more of an appendix or hypothetical object rather than as part of the thesis - there were only a few quite low quality images of the sculpture over the course of its making included at the end.\
It was funny that I was reading the text as a low quality, non-OCR\'92d scan of what appeared to be a photocopy of the original printed copy. It felt like I\'92d been passed on a secret, mythical object of the Kingston PhD programme. Often talked about, but rarely seen.\

 \
My wife went to work and took the car. We had a small argument because I said I needed the car to go shopping but then realised that she should just have it because her back hurt if she walked to the station so I said I would walk to Asda instead of driving to the big Tesco. She got angry and said that I should have reminded her I was going shopping. I said I thought she knew, because she\'92d just shouted downstairs that she needed something and I should add it to the list. She said that she might have known, but that it didn\'92t excuse me for not reminding her. I could tell that she could tell that she was being a bit unreasonable so I was laughing but she maintained her anger until she left.\
After I came back from shopping my wife messaged me saying she was sorry for being angry because she was pregnant and hormonal.\
I spent the morning working on a set of performance videos. Each video followed a similar structure: one performer sat on a chair reading a book, then the other performer walked into shot and asked them what they were reading. The first performer showed them the book and then, either the second performer said, \'91That\'92s a big book\'92 and they both looked to camera, or, the first performer then threw the book out of frame and then they both looked to camera. There were five different books: Marx\'92s Capital Volume 1, Cervantes\'92 Don Quixote, Karl Ove Knausgaard\'92s My Struggle Volume 1, James Joyce\'92s Ulysses and David Foster Wallace\'92s Infinite Jest. All big books in many ways. This was one of the few properly iterative videos that we\'92d shot. I liked the idea of having multiple videos with slight variations. As I edited, I added sound effects, and ridiculous zooms and edits. I pitched the performers\'92 voices up and down, added reverb to the sound of the book hitting the floor. It was surreal, and banal, but I felt quite hypnotised by the repetition with differences. It was satisfying to know the structure and then be able to add in the edits, or synced sound, or stupid VFX or zooms. They were more or less funny, more or less surreal, more or less ridiculous, based on the very slight differences between the videos. It was like a science experiment, but with aesthetics, and for no reason, and without a hypothesis.\
After lunch I attended an online seminar about art schools. It was boring. Someone spoke about art schools without walls, and how if the world was better then art schools wouldn't need to exist. It was boring. I didn\'92t care about utopias. I knew that I was privileged, but I also knew that my need to make art was pathological and I didn\'92t want to give that up, and that the idea of utopia destroying art schools was irritating to me, because it wouldn\'92t fix my pathology, but it would negate my autonomy, and so it was a world I would never live in, and therefore couldn\'92t contribute to, and therefore to dedicate my life to such a goal would be insane, almost suicidal. A few of the respondents said that it seemed weird for university lecturers to be talking about abolishing the art school, and that for many people, art school was an escape from a cruel, harsh capitalist world, rather than one of the problems created by capitalism. I agreed with them.\
 \

 \
I spent the morning making the book/reading videos, then made a coffee and wrote my application for a job at a college that offered degrees in my hometown in Essex. I had done my foundation art & design course there almost 20 years ago. I was kind of excited by the job, there was a perverse kind of uncanny feeling about teaching at somewhere that I had studied, and it being in my hometown. I was also slightly more likely to get an interview than for the jobs I was applying for in London.\
We had pasta for lunch, then I worked on videos more, then my wife had a Zoom meeting with a health visitor. I sat in the living room, off camera but listening just in case it was useful for me to contribute, but then our posh neighbour came round to drop off some leaflets for us to distribute in our estate about the upcoming Hillyfields fayre. I stood and chatted with her outside for 20 minutes or so. When I came back inside my wife\'92s appointment was over.\
I went back upstairs, tweaked my application and sent it, then carried on working on the videos until I finished all the ones with Daniel reading. The next day I resolved to finish the videos where Tammy read.\
We prepared the ingredients for a moussaka, then went out into the grey, cloudy day to post all the leaflets. It was intriguing to see the other side of the flats in our estate. We came back home, arranged the moussaka elements in a dish and put it in the oven. I got a beer and poured my wife a diet coke. My wife rested while I wrote my diary and drank beer.\
My wife asked me to read out my diary entry from earlier in the year on the day we found out we were pregnant. In the diary entry, I wrote about my wife criticising my driving, and then I\'92d written a very long exegesis of our argument, and then my understanding of where my fragility regarding criticism came from. It was very long and heartfelt and sad. It was about my dad, and about my worries about being a dad. My wife said that I hadn\'92t told her all this. I said that she was right, I hadn\'92t, I had written it all down. It felt nice to tell her.\
The moussaka came out of the oven and looked tasty but we had to wait for another 30 minutes before we could eat it. While we waited for the moussaka to cool down I showed my wife some of the videos I had made that day and she said she didn\'92t understand why anything was happening and I laughed and said that was fine.\
 \
Friday 16th July 2021\
 \
I spent the morning editing more reading videos, but this time Tammy doing the reading and Daniel asking what they were reading. The editing had become more complex as I had made more iterations - for example, I had started rotating the footage as well as zooming in, and automating the pitch and yaw settings for the videos so they looked even weirder. Part of the reason was to make the job of making the videos more interesting as I went along, but they also, to me, did make the videos funnier. Or \'93funnier\'94 at least. I wondered vaguely if they might be popular on YouTube if I released them. Like, maybe weird YouTube people might like them.\

 \
I had an insect bite on my leg and through the night it got worse and worse. In the morning I was hobbling around and my ankle was swollen. My wife was worried - she gasped when she saw my ankle, but we decided to leave it for a few days and see if it got better.\
My wife gave me a card for our anniversary and I realised I\'92d forgotten to make her a card. I felt bad. Why was I so forgetful?\
We had breakfast and got ready. I felt tired and dopey and anxious. I asked my wife to drive so I could wear crocs and let my insect bite get some air on it. We drove to Charlton, to the lido. It was lovely to swim in an outdoor pool but it was busier than Lewisham pool, and I felt a bit nervous because it was an unfamiliar place. After swimming for a while I realised I should have had sun cream on my balding head. My eyes hurt because of the sun. I\'92d forgotten my goggles and was using my wife\'92s and they kept letting bits of water in. The pool was incredibly shallow at one end and my legs kept hitting the ground. At the same time I recognised that we were having an objectively lovely time - it was hot and sunny, it was our anniversary and we were at a beautiful outdoor swimming pool.\
We left after an hour or so, drove to Sainsbury\'92s and got some bits, then went home and I made iced coffee for us. We sat in the garden which was still in the shade, then got ready with a picnic and went to the park.\
We found a tree to sit under and watched the cricket. I was still nervous and anxious. We ate our egg mayonnaise sandwiches and crisps and drank water from a big bottle that my wife had put in the freezer. As we were eating, a middle aged guy walked quite close to us on his phone. He was telling the other person that the park was full of fucking rubbish and that people were just laying around in it. He told the other person that they wouldn\'92t be laying around in it (the rubbish) if it (the rubbish) was dead bodies. He said he was fucked off, because now he\'92d have to come and sort it all out. He kind of circled around us, then went back the way he came. He went out of earshot, but I saw him kick some rubbish, pick some up and throw it, and punch a tree. I assumed he was a nutter, but later he came back with gloves, a litter grabber, and one of those hoops with a bin bag attached that suggested he was a serious amateur rubbish collector. Then, I heard him talking to people, asking if they wanted to put anything in his bag, and he was being really polite and friendly. No tree punching. I thought about Nietzsche and resentment and how it ate away at you. I imagined his weird life, maybe he was retired, and spent all his spare time walking around the park looking for rubbish to be angry about. Or maybe I\'92d got it totally wrong and he was actually a council employee in charge of the rubbish team who had cleaned up after the fair the day before and was annoyed because they\'92d done a bad job.\

Monday 19th July 2021\
 \
We slept badly because of the heat. I got up and slept in the other room with the window open because my wife had asked me to close the window because there was the faint, irritating sound of loud music playing in the distance all through the night.\
In the early morning I came back to bed and slept with my eye mask on. My wife woke me up just before 8 and I went downstairs and made some breakfast.\
When my wife had left for work I put on some clothes and walked slowly up to the park with a Harun Farocki book. It was very hot. I bought a coffee and read the introduction written by someone else - I\'92d read a few of the essays by Farocki already, but I thought the intro would give me a good overview of his work.\
Next to me a man sat drinking coffee with his dog at his feet. Another dog came over and his dog barked at it. The other dog owner came over and they chatted about their dogs. The other owner was an experienced chatter - making a joke about the breed of the man\'92s dog being a Tibetan terrier by asking if he had to pick it up from Tibet. It turned out the man had had it shipped over from Poland last year in the puppy craze when you couldn\'92t buy a puppy anywhere. Eventually the other owner looked at his own dog and said that it had a dirty willy. Then the other owner told the man that he\'92d recently read about a dog who\'92d tried to hump a hedgehog and ended up with his bits in a right old mess. Quills snapped off. Terrible.\
I watched a big tractor with a lawnmower attachment driving around the park mowing the grass. The driver executed a series of tight turns to mow around the outdoor gym equipment while the gym users waited around for him, presumably a bit annoyed by being interrupted by a tractor.\
Back at home I closed the curtains and opened the windows in the second bedroom and worked in my pants. I drank water and edited the last of the reading videos. I made an iced coffee to drink while I worked and finished them all before lunch.\
In the afternoon it was cloudier but still hot. I worked on a longer video of the performers pretending to sleep. I edited lots of different shots together, finishing with a long shot of me walking around the performers\'92 prone bodies, adjusting a microphone to record their breathing. I reversed the chroma key on the last long shot, so instead of the green screen disappearing, the performers disappeared.\
Under the first set of shots I placed a video of Anselm Kiefer pouring lead on his canvases, under the long reversed-chroma video, I laid a video of clouds shot from above so that the performers were glowing, full of clouds. I put a soundtrack of some ambient music I\'92d made a few years ago over the second section. Over the first section I laid a recording of me reading out dreams I\'92d had over the past year and recorded in my diary. My voice was close miked, and pitched down low, barely legible really, but occasional words giving you the gist that this was a man reading out his dreams.\
I uploaded the video to the Box drive we were using for the project. I made a tonic water with bitters, a slice of lemon and ice. I sat in the living room and read Rachel Cattle\'92s thesis. My second supervisor had recommended it and it had been in my unread Google Chrome tabs for a long time. It was good, but a little self-conscious with lots of different devices - like talking about the reader as a stylus on a record player, the thesis as a broadcast, and something about radio(activity) which was kind of from Walter Benjamin but not. It took a while for it to get anywhere but eventually she started writing about the work she had done and then it made a bit more sense. Hers was clearly a thesis which had a clear practice element - which was a record, and lots of printed leaflets, zines etc., and a distinct written thesis which explained all the different practice elements, the methodology etc., which was what I was reading.\

 \
We had a swim, bought some veg for the week from the little Sainsburys. I worked on videos all day. I thought about going to the studio and picking up a putting machine to film with the next day but decided that we wouldn\'92t have enough time and it wasn\'92t worth it.\
 \
Wednesday 21st July 2021\
 \
I got the train to Surbiton, then walked towards Kingston Uni where we were filming that day. On the way I went to Waitrose to pick up some food for the performers to eat while I filmed them. I knew I wanted them to eat coleslaw, and a packet of ready salted crisps, but I also decided to buy a few other food items on the basis of whatever I thought was funny at the time. I decided on mini quorn snack eggs, and baked beans. Mini quorn snack eggs had a kind of ridiculous vegetarian vibe, and baked beans had a kind of 90s, Red Nose day, Chris Evans feeling which I liked.\
When I got to uni I went to the library to return an unhelpful book on gesture. I opened my bag and one of the coleslaw pots had exploded in my bag, covering my belongings in mayo and cabbage. I wiped down the book and returned it, then carried my bag and my coleslaw coated stuff through to the cafeteria. I bought a coffee and then used some blu roll to wipe everything down. I got everything clean, but my water bottle remained greasy and my bag smelled bad.\
I read a bit of Mladen Dolar\'92s book on the materiality of the voice - or the object voice as he called it. I found the book a bit Zizeky, like a bit too far towards the clever clever showy end of psychoanalytic theoretical writing but there was something quite methodical about the way he dealt with different aspects of the voice.\
My performers arrived and we got a coffee and sat in the sun for a bit. I had been a bit worried that Tammy had reflected on our previous days of filming - particularly our shame conversation - and perhaps felt that they had been exploited in some way, but I realised slowly that this was just a little bit of my paranoia on my part.\
We got into the studio and got sorted out. At first I couldn't get the camera working but I realised that someone had changed the settings and I got them back to what I thought were the right settings.\
We filmed eating first and it was quite compelling to watch the performers eat baked beans and coleslaw with their hands. Daniel asked if they were eating and swallowing or whether they could spit the food out because he was on week four of his very restrictive diet which basically meant no carbs, sugar, dairy or anything. I thought maybe it was quite a good idea if they both spat everything out after they chewed it. That was quite hell-like, I reasoned. I taped a bin bag to a projector stand and put it in front of the camera so they could spit out what they ate after they chewed it.\
Tammy didn\'92t like baked beans so they gagged a few times and warned me in advance that they might throw up but they didn\'92t mind if I carried on filming. In the end they didn\'92t vomit but they also didn\'92t eat the whole can.\
I cleaned up the floor at the end with some wipes while the performers went to the toilets and washed their hands and faces.\
We filmed another discussion, this time about power. I limited us to a 20 minute conversation. It wasn\'92t quite as good, I thought, as the first one about shame. Maybe it was always going to be weird to have edited and captioned the first discussion about shame before going on to film the second and third discussion. \
Before lunch we shot a simple set up where the performers pretended to draw on a big flipchart paper pad, and then the other performer came in and asked them what they were drawing.\
We had lunch but there was no hot food - presumably because it was the summer holidays and there weren\'92t many students about. I ate a bad pasta salad, then had a coffee.\
After lunch we filmed lots of shots of the performers holding up different drawings, of a penis, a poo, a swan, a big S like kids learned to draw at school and that big nose guy who looked over a wall. Then we filmed lots of different reactions: shock, disgust, contempt, condescension, laughter, being impressed etc. I\'92d cut all these together and make multiple iterations of the drawing videos.\
We then filmed the third discussion, about the idea of \'91normal\'92 and again it was ok, but it still felt a bit less interesting than the one about shame. Also afterwards Daniel was embarrassed at what he'd said, which he claimed was a bit teenager-y about being different and a weirdo. I said I didn\'92t mind if it was a bit cringy, because part of the idea was to directly refer to ideas that were embarrassing when you referred to them directly. Daniel said he was also fine with what he\'92d said, in the context of it being a performance about these things.\
We finished up and then Tammy drove us home. She dropped Daniel off near his house, then dropped me off outside mine. Tammy was going to Latitude festival to perform at the weekend, then moving house the following week. They felt nervous about the festival. They weren\'92t ready for big crowds of people or live gigs with audiences at close quarters. They said they were going to try and enjoy it, and cut themselves some slack if they couldn\'92t handle it.\

 \
I realised that all the footage I had shot was RAW, meaning I had to process it before I could work with it, otherwise it would look really washed out and shitty. I tried to change the curves and the saturation in my editing software but it seemed to make the preview go really slow and I couldn\'92t get it looking right.\
It was super hot and I cycled to meet my Peruvian friend Andrea at Gasworks gallery where she worked as the maternity cover for the public programmes curator. While I waited for her to finish up her work I spent 30 minutes in the galleries looking at a solo exhibition by a video artist with a middle eastern name who lived in Ireland. It was all about masculinity and it was good but a bit of a self consciously, almost cliched \'91queer artist\'92 exhibition, with wet bodies and monstrous animals queering what I assumed was meant to be a straight looking male character. Everything in these works was always shiny. Still, it was good. I kept thinking about one of the boys on Love Island who was going through a very sad crisis of masculinity where he wanted to \'91be a man\'92 but didn\'92t know what that meant and kept just offending other people and making them sad with his decisions. I thought that Love Island was maybe a better artwork about contemporary masculinity than this, but it was fair enough to make a work about masculinity and it wasn\'92t the worst example.\
 \
Friday 23rd July 2021\
 \
My wife had a midwife appointment around midday so we had a bit of a slow morning, finished watching the previous evening\'92s episode of Love Island, and walked around the park.\
Once I got going with work, we had a knock on the door and some maintenance people had arrived to work on the bust guttering on the bin store next to our back garden. I showed them where it was, and then a delivery person arrived with my premium copy of Davinci that I\'92d ordered in a panic when I'd first realised that I\'92d got the wrong footage from the camera.\
I spoke to my cameraman friend and he gave me some tips about LUTs, or Look Up Tables, which were basically camera presets which you could apply to RAW footage in editing software. After speaking to him and emailing the techs at Kingston, I felt a bit more in control of the footage and got it looking how I wanted. This meant there was no urgency to update my copy of Davinci, which would have involved updating my operating system. I decided to wait until after I\'92d finished this project - change it all in August when I wasn\'92t working to a deadline.\
 \
Saturday 24th July 2021\
 \
We had some breakfast. Then I cleaned the car with my wife\'92s mum\'92s hose. Then we joined an antenatal Zoom on my wife\'92s ipad and I drank coffee and made notes. We didn\'92t learn loads of new stuff, but it was useful to refresh lots of stuff that I\'92d read about at the start of my wife\'92s pregnancy. The midwife was into hypnobirthing stuff too so that was good. She spoke about breathing and relaxation being the key to being in control.\
We drove to my wife\'92s dad\'92s house. His girlfriend had recently had an operation on her broken arm. It had been successful but it would delay the start of her chemotherapy. She had managed, even with one arm, to make a quiche, a huge pork pie and a potato salad. Our little tomato salad felt like a measly addition.\
  The weather was meant to have been bad but it was warm so we ate outside on a picnic bench by the stream that ran through their garden. We talked about baby stuff, and about my wife\'92s dad\'92s girlfriend\'92s stay in hospital. She said she had been very grateful for a very floppy bit of toast that she got from the catering trolley the morning after the operation. Steamed toast, she called it. She said there had been three other women on the ward, all with advanced dementia, all having hip operations. One moaned and asked where she was, one screamed obscenities at the nurses, and one just lay there with her mouth open, head tipped back.\
  We had a cup of tea and somehow me and my wife\'92s dad ended up in a big conversation about the state of the nation. He was an intelligent man, and by no means uninformed, but occasionally it astounded me that he didn\'92t know certain big strokes of modern political history. He was angry about why councils didn\'92t just build their own houses - they were always talking about how they needed houses, but they always lined their own pockets with private deals. I knew he was a big fan of Thatcher, and I felt bad having to say that the tories in the 80s had basically stopped councils building housing with right to buy and borrowing limits. As I said it I was suddenly a bit uncertain of the specifics - but that was kind of the point. There was a whole swathe of the country that didn\'92t know about the right to buy, or maybe about Section 28, or the response to the AIDS crisis, or maybe the WMD dossier or... I didn\'92t even know what they didn\'92t know, because I just supposed that people knew the same things as me - maybe they knew more, or more detail - particularly older people, because they lived through it, but maybe that was part of the reason they didn\'92t know about it? Maybe we wouldn't really understand what was happening in our own time and our children\'92s generation would be confused about our views about what happened during the Coronavirus pandemic.\
My wife\'92s brother came over with his baby daughter and we all cooed and held her. I hadn;t seen her for a month and she had developed lots of new facial expressions and was smiling a lot. My wife held her and my wife\'92s dad mugged for her, making silly noises and taking pictures. The baby smiled, then every time she smiled, she buried her head in my wife\'92s shoulders - like she was embarrassed of being caught smiling. But she couldn\'92t be embarrassed in a socialised way - she didn\'92t have the capacity for shame about her body or her feelings or her thoughts. But apparently, she connected joy with hiding herself from the sight of others.\
That evening, we went to my parents and ate dinner with them in their garden. I drank two beers and tried to convince my parents to carry on looking into whether they might travel to Canada to see my sister\'92s family before the kids started back at school. My mum was still bitter and sad about the whole thing. She said several times that it had been their choice to move to Canada, and that she couldn\'92t be bothered to deal with the danger of Covid, or quarantine, or a complex flight with a transfer. I got a bit angry, but I managed to convince them to at least carry on looking into it so that they knew that they really couldn\'92t go, rather than just dismissing it after running into some problems, and then possibly regretting it if my sister\'92s family couldn\'92t come to the UK for Christmas.\
Following on from this, in the living room eating mini waitrose ice creams, we got into a weird argument about trans politics. They were talking the nonsense about men using their status as trans women to attack women in toilets and it made me very angry. We eventually finished the conversation trying to be civil, but I felt sad that they were manipulated by targeted news articles, or the Daily Mail, or wherever it was that they read these things.\
In the car on the way back to my wife\'92s mum\'92s house I said I felt weird about the conversation I'd had with my parents. I said I felt like I\'92d shouted at them and I hadn\'92t liked it. When we got back to the house I messaged them and told them that I hadn\'92t meant to get angry at them, and that I didn\'92t think they were crazy Daily Mail people.\
\
Monday 26th July 2021\
 \
My wife went to work. I got dressed and took some stuff from filming back down to the studio. There had been a lot of rain and some people on the studio WhatsApp group had been saying their studios were flooded. Our studio was fine, but there was a small chance that our studio could flood via the fire door so I moved some sculptures off the ground and put them on the wall. I bought milk on the way home and started work.\
Throughout the day I made 11 videos. I finished the eating videos, changing the voiceover each time so now it was Daniel saying, \'91This is accessibility\'92 in a pitched up voice, now Tammy saying, \'91This is neurodiversity\'92 in a pitched down voice, now Daniel saying, \'91This is neurodiversity\'92 in a pitched up voice, now Tammy saying, \'91This is accessibility\'92 in a pitched down voice. I realised that I could have made more iterations of the videos with different combinations of the voiceovers and foods, but I didn\'92t because of time constraints.\
For lunch I had rice, stir fried mushrooms and chinese sausage, boiled green beans, grated carrot with black vinegar and chilli oil, and miso soup made from the green bean water. I ate it while reading the new issue of the LRB. I pottered around for a bit, trying to rearrange the honeysuckle on the wall of the garden where the maintenance people had pulled it away when they fixed the pipe the week before. I watered the tomato plants and noted that some more tomatoes were fruiting. I washed up and then went back upstairs.\
In the afternoon I did the ladder videos, where the performers took turns going up a ladder, and when they got to the top I cut in another shot of them pretending to look around and survey what they could see from the top. Behind them I put an image of mountains, or deep space, and found appropriate sound effects. Again, I felt like I could have done endless versions of them - with the performers popping their heads up into various absurd situations, but I felt like space and mountains were a good representative selection of the kind of thing you might see if you were very very high up which was the point of the videos.\
II finished off by making two simple videos; one take performances where all I had to do was key the footage, add background video, titles and some music. This took me until 4pm and my back hurt and I couldn\'92t bear to do any more videos.\
I made a cup of tea and did some reading and admin. I read an interview with Carolyn Lazard, and then I finished the first chapter of Mladen Dolar\'92s \'91A Voice and Nothing More\'92. I had supervision the next day with my first supervisor but I couldn\'92t quite bear to re-read the chapter on tone from Sianne Ngai which was what I\'92d said we would talk about.\
I did my diary, then at 6pm, got a beer and watched Brecht\'92s film, Kuhle Wampe or The Empty Plan and took notes. My wife was going swimming and then meeting her friend, so I was on my own for the evening. The file I had stopped working after 20 minutes so I had to watch it on archive.org but it was a weird digital version - it looked like it had image stabilisation applied to it, but that meant that occasionally the subtitles wobbled around and a few times the whole shot went woozy, rocking back and forth as though the camera operator was drunk.\
 \
 \
Tuesday 27th July 2021\
 \
I went swimming but my wife hadn\'92t booked a spot so I was on my own. I came home and worked on the drawing videos for the performance. These were videos where one performer pretended to draw, then the other performer came in and asked them what they were drawing, and the performer held up their drawing, then we cut to what they held up which was one of five simple drawings - a penis, a heart, a dog, the big nose guy with his nose over the wall etc - and then we cut to a number of different reactions - shocked, disgusted, laughing, impressed etc. I realised that with the number of drawings and reactions that I would have way too many combinations so I decided to limit it to two reactions per video. That still meant I had to make around 20 videos.\
I worked, first getting the structural clips ready, graded and keyed and edited, then cutting in the different drawings and reactions, then rendering and uploading.\
After lunch I had a supervision with my first supervisor, though it was on Teams rather than in person as we\'92d originally planned. We chatted for a bit, then talked about plans for next year. I said maybe, depending on how this performance to camera work went, I might make the whole PhD about this single work rather than lots of different works. That way, I could just write a series of texts around the work, which might give the thesis its coherence, rather than having to arrange a number of quite different works alongside a number of quite different texts. My supervisor agreed that this would streamline the process, as we could just spend the next two years working on the written part of the thesis.\
After the meeting I carried on with the videos. I was in the part of the making process where I knew what I was doing. I was in flow. It was very boring and hard work but it was easy and I knew what I was going for. As I edited I had strange dreamlike memories return to me, from my teenage years, or from childhood. I noticed them as they appeared to me, but after they disappeared I couldn\'92t recall them.\
I spoke to the producer of the online project. We discussed a solution to one of the coding issues which made it slightly less complex for her to do. It meant that it would never be truly randomised in terms of the sequencing of the sections, but that was fine by me.\
I finished most of the drawing videos before I realised I\'92d missed out the subtitles. I went back in and added the subtitles - it was literally just one line, where the performer asked the other one what they were drawing - then re-rendered all the videos and re-uploaded them.\
In the evening we ate fried rice and then watched Love Island. This week was Casa Amor, which was where the boys went to another house and new girls came in and tried to couple up with them. I found it horrifying and stressful and had to spend some time on my phone looking at twitter to avoid the cringey bits like where the disabled contestant was refused a bed by all of the girls he asked, even though, to stay in the show, they had to couple up with someone.\
 \
Wednesday 28th July 2021\
 \
In the morning I worked on what was meant to be one video where the performers asked each other how they were feeling, then the other one screamed, or laughed, or whistled or made a weird noise. In the end I made them all as different videos, so now, after various extra videos instead of around 90 videos I was probably going to make around 130 videos.\
I made some coffee and phoned my art friend in Newcastle. He\'92d messaged me to ask if I\'92d be willing to publicly de-author some work we had made for a show at the Zabludowicz collection back in 2015. I had been thinking about it alot because quite a few artists had been doing it recently, but I had decided that as a public, symbolic act I wasn\'92t on board, and it felt quite a lot like people couldn\'92t live with their shame and wanted a kind of public baptism which rubbed me up the wrong way. You could not, I thought, absolve your complicity with colonial violence, particularly if you were British and that violence was in Palestine. However, if he wanted to do it, I would happily do it and it would, I thought to myself, allow me to feel more comfortable when critiquing Israeli colonial violence on social media, and yet I really didn\'92t want to do a public social media post about de-authoring the work for the gallery. I\'92d worked there as a gallery assistant for years. I had always known the situation. In fact for years, I\'92d been annoyed that the art boycott activists always got their facts wrong about the money that funded the trust that funded the gallery. It felt like they were idiots, and even after I stopped working there, and after I\'92d decided I probably wouldn\'92t show with them again, I hadn\'92t wanted to get involved in the politics around it. More recently the activists had got their facts right and some other people had written some more insightful comments explaining the position of the boycott. It felt to me more like veganism than a political action, but if he wanted to do it I was happy.\
We decided he would lead on the de-authoring, maybe he would talk to a mutual friend who had worked there and recently de-authored her work and find out what she had done. The more I thought about it the weirder it was. I had to explain that we\'92d signed a contract and that the gallery would keep our work on their website. And obviously we weren\'92t going to give them our very small fee back. And obviously I wasn\'92t going to give back my 7 years of wages. Anyway. I said I would let him sort it out. If he wanted to absolve me of our sings that was fine.\
I spent the rest of the day working on the power discussion video. First, I motion tracked a little orange ball on a stick that I was holding in the performance and then tracked a picture of a poo on top of it. Then I keyed out the green background and my green screen suit and placed us in the living room setting where I\'92d set the last discussion. I transcribed the video at just under half speed, stopping it occasionally to edit. Then I made a cup of tea and started subtitling the video. Halfway through the afternoon I stopped subtitling and went through to grade all the footage before I did any editing because once I chopped the footage then I\'92d have an issue where I had to basically click the mouse more times to apply the colour grade to more clips. I was getting better at workflow - ordering the editing process so that it was more sensible and less work.\
I got an email from the Colchester Institute telling me I had an interview for the Course Leader job for their Fine Art BA. I was really happy, but now I had to prepare for the interview on top of making the performance to camera videos.\
 \
Thursday 29th July 2021\
 \
When I woke up my wife told me that she\'92d had some discharge in her underwear in the night. She googled it and thought that she should phone the midwife in case it was amniotic fluid. I decided to start work early in case we needed to go to the maternity unit. I got a cup of tea and went to my computer while my wife rang the midwife.\
  I made notes of the memories I had while editing: an older boy at a daytime house party when I was maybe 14 or 15 saying to a girl that he liked her small hands because it made his penis look big and it being a very funny line to everyone in the room; having a brunch with a famous professor from Goldsmiths and not impressing her, partly because I was overwhelmed by eating breakfast with her in what felt to me like a kind of old London restaurant of the sort that isn\'92t particularly expensive, but that only rich people tended to eat in; going for a drink somewhere near Borough with a friend from Glasgow and her boyfriend and it being a cold evening and us sitting on a small table and me not enjoying myself that much and leaving after a few drinks and before the night was really over.\
My wife said that the midwife told her to go to the maternity ward and get checked. She told me to drive her and drop her off as there was no point in me coming in as I\'92d just have to wait outside.\
I drove her to the maternity unit, turned the car around and came home. I edited and waited for news. Eventually my wife said that everything seemed fine and she was just waiting for a doctor to give her a checkup before she came home. We planned to meet in the park and get a coffee before lunch.\
She ended up waiting for two or so hours. Also in that time she received a message from the Lewisham midwife team saying that because of Covid and staff shortages, the birth centre might not be available - it would change from day to day depending on staff availability.\
 I worked all morning, but half distracted by my phone, waiting for my wife to text to say she was ready to be picked up. Eventually I had a shit lunch and when I had washed up my wife said she was ready. I drove down and got her. She said she had thrush and the doctor had put a speculum up her and it wasn\'92t very nice.\
We got home and my wife had some food. Then she said she would go to the pharmacy to get the drugs the doctor had prescribed. I had a shower while she was out. She came back 20 minutes later saying that the pharmacist told her that they couldn\'92t fill the prescription there, she would have to go back to the hospital. The doctor hadn\'92t told her that. We were both really annoyed. I drove her to the hospital, dropped her off, then waited on one of the residential streets. It took her about 45 minutes to get her prescription, then I drove round and picked her up again.\
We came home and I made a cup of tea. I felt annoyed and frustrated. I tried to make an animated gif for the background of the website. The producer of the piece had asked me to make a gif at around 2000 x 1000px but I realised that this was really big and the file size was relatively large which seemed like it wouldn\'92t make sense for something that needed to load very quickly. I had real trouble making the gif in Photoshop. I kept getting an error message every time I tried to change the settings to make it smaller. My wife came in and started plucking my monobrow in the middle of all this and I must have snapped at her because she stopped and told me to do it myself. Now I had offended my wife and I was annoyed at everything else too.\
 \
Sunday 1st August 2021\
 \
We got up and had some breakfast. Then my wife made some food and packed up and went off to Buckingham Palace with her mum and sister.\
I went for a walk around the park and sat on a bench looking towards Crystal Palace and listening to a podcast about cryptocurrency and wellness culture.\
I came home, showered, made a massive coffee and worked on one of the presentations I had to do for my interview for the job in Colchester. I wrote a professional practice session about applying to things - I collected lots of different artist opportunities, looked at the application forms for a few of them and designed a two part session that explained why we apply to things, what kind of opportunities were out there, and how to approach application forms. Then I devised a kind of simplified application process that I would ask the students to do for homework, then wrote about how we would use the second session to look at the homework as a group. I wrote a lot. Then I ate lunch and carried on working on it.\
I felt tired at one point, and stopped for a bit to watch the end of a Farocki film. I thought I had about 20 minutes left, but it turned out that it was only 3 minutes, and then it cut to some German TV programmes, which felt quite nice, because of course I was watching the digital version of a VHS tape, which could have easily been edited to cut the TV off the end, but it was nice to retain the extra video. Completely pointless, meaningless to me and illegible.\
My wife messaged and said she was on her way home. I worked a bit more on my presentation, but laying on the sofa, so much more slowly.\
When my wife got home we chatted about Buckingham Palace. My wife said that her mum had enjoyed it. At one point, when they were sitting having their picnic, her mum had said that she hadn\'92t seen anyone she\'92d known yet. My wife and her sister had laughed at her, asking who she expected to see that she knew at Buckingham Palace and their mum had said she just meant in general, that you normally saw someone you knew when you went out. My wife told me this in the kind of amazed tone that people reserved for the sacred mysteries of the world and the inexplicable behaviour of their parents.\
In the evening I tried out my presentation on my wife and we realised I needed to cut a lot.\
 \
Monday 2nd August 2021\
 \
My wife took the day off because her back hurt. I slept until 8:30 which was late for me. I thought maybe we would go for a walk later so I got to work on a video. I thought it would be quick, but in the end it took me right up until lunch to do it. Then, after lunch I realised I hadn\'92t put subtitles on it so I went back to it and did the subtitling. It was a long process and I was annoyed at having to do it, but then I also was aware that I was editing the video as I went and making it better. I had to accept that in the end it made the video better, but I was also aware that I had lots of videos to make, and one video per day was not acceptable.\
I started working on the other presentation that I had to do for the interview. This one was more straightforward - about my experience and skills. But it was still boring to do.\
I came downstairs around 6. My wife was watching TV. We went for a walk around the park and it wasn\'92t that warm. We sat on a bench and talked about how pregnant my wife felt. Her back hurt, her neck and shoulders hurt. She felt very big but she knew she was going to get bigger.\
Back at home I texted the band group chat. We tried to organise a practice, but then it turned out that the singer and the drummer were both going on really long holidays over August so we wouldn\'92t be able to practice again until September, just before we were going to have the baby.\
 \
Tuesday 3rd August 2021\
 \
We had a swim, then I went to Sainsbury\'92s to buy some fruit and veg. Back at home I showered and worked on another video. I was slightly anxious about my second vaccination later that day, and I could feel that it was affecting the way I thought about the video, which I thought was a bit shit. It was certainly less funny than the one I\'92d made the day before, but the aim of the project was not to make funny videos, I reminded myself. However, as with the last video, when I wrote the subtitles, the video did somehow become funnier. It was as though it pointed out the comedy of a response or a situation, without the performance necessarily having to carry the humour all on its own.\
I had a coffee, then read out one of my presentations for the next day\'92s video. It was weird that at this point I couldn\'92t know how the interview would turn out, but in a few days time I would be 100% certain of the outcome. Time was weird. The presentation was messy and not great. I felt worried about the interview.\
After lunch in the garden I got myself ready and walked to the train station. I was nervous about the jab. I wasn\'92t nervous about the injection, or about the side effects, but rather I was nervous about the possibility of having a panic attack and fainting. Acute anxiety was strange in that way - it became a kind of meta-response to the possibility of itself.\
I found it hard to read my magazine while I waited, but in the vaccination booth I was totally fine, chatting with the volunteers and appearing completely unfazed - probably I was distracted by the need to hold a conversation and appear normal.\
In the waiting area I sat and felt worried about fainting. I suddenly decided to go and ask to lay down, and the lady pointed me to a hospital bed behind a screen. She was very nice. She told me to drink water and got me some biscuits. I basically felt fine as soon as I approached her, but I thought I may as well stay on the bed for my allotted 15 minute waiting time. I ate my biscuits, drank my water, and felt the pain spread in my arm. I knew it was fine - just the result of my muscles having something injected into them - but all the same it made me feel weird. I didn\'92t like being confronted with the fact of my own body.\
Once my time was up I thanked the lady and walked back to London Bridge. I felt a bit panicky on the train, but again, it was the worry about fainting in a public place that was making me feel lightheaded.\
I decided I deserved some treats just in case I felt bad later so I bought some Lucozade, some chocolate hobnobs and a bar of Dairy Milk.\
I got home and my wife was on a call so I took my Lucozade upstairs and rehearsed my presentations. The Lucozade and the distraction of speaking out loud for half an hour relaxed me and I started to feel more confident about the interview. I felt good and happy and had a lot of energy.\
Me and my wife chatted for a bit, then she went downstairs for a nap and I rehearsed my talks again, this time with a cup of tea. I timed them and managed to keep them to around 10 minutes, which was meant to be the limit.\
We went for a wander around the park. I felt less anxious over time, though when I noticed my arm hurting it set off a wave of negative feeling through my body. By the time we got home I was very hungry and thirsty.\
I made black bean chilli, rice and salsa and once I\'92d eaten I felt much better. That was probably part of why I\'92d felt a bit lightheaded at the park. I wrote my diary and as I wrote it I wondered if writing about the anxious feelings would help dispel them. It partly did, I thought, but also I couldn\'92t tell. It was weird to feel positively and also ambivalently, or maybe that was the nature of ambivalence.\
 \
Wednesday 4th August\
 \
I slept fine, no panic attacks, no freakouts. I had my interview for Colchester Institute at 9am so I was glad to have had a good sleep. I got dressed, ate, and went out for a walk. I had plenty of time, so I went over the park and down towards the cemetery. The gates were locked so I walked around it on the main road. The side gates were open so I went through them, thinking I could cut back through the main gates, then up back over the park. But the main gates were closed, so I had to turn around, walk back towards the side gate, then back round the road, then back over the park and back home.\
I only had 30 minutes to shower, put my contacts in, get a cup of tea and get set up. I rushed getting ready, but still only managed to practice one of my talks for a few minutes before I had to join the Zoom meeting.\
We said our hellos and then I gave my presentations. They seemed to go down well, then we chatted and it felt like the interview was going really well, even though I felt like I didn\'92t have the answers to some of the questions. I started to feel like they were kind of coaching me through the interview, which was kind of them, but also slightly unnerving, as though they really needed me to be successful because maybe I was the only person who\'92d applied, or the only decent application or something.\
We finished the interview and I messaged a few people, made coffee, then started doing serious research into the commute times, and the money situation. I had only really vaguely thought about the actual concrete implications of working in Colchester two or three days a week. I felt a bit weird about the job, suddenly, because I had some more information about what it actually entailed, and it felt a bit more real. They had also mentioned another job, which was two days rather than three and wasn\'92t the course leader role, and I thought about how I wished I\'92d seen that and applied for that rather than the course leader job, which was a bit scarier and had more responsibility.\
I went for a walk and laid in the park for a bit, thinking, but also relaxing and basking in the energy that I\'92d got from the interview going well.\
I came home and ate lunch, then started working on the video work. I started transcribing the final discussion video about normativity. Halfway through I saw a big long email from Claire, who ran the online project space where the online version of the work was showing. She\'92d emailed Rob, the coder I was working with on the physical version of the work and had cop[ied me in.She had a big problem with the website and she had lots of questions for him. I saw that, responded to a few things she\'92d asked me, and then the coder rang me. We ended up having a long chat, talking about different video editing systems, about the vaccine - he\'92d had astra zeneca months ago and had a bad reaction - and about the plan for the video installation he was going to help me make. I realised halfway through our conversation that he hadn\'92t actually seen any of the videos so I sent him a link to the online folder containing all the videos and he flicked through while we chatted.\
We finished up and I sent him the producer\'92s number so he could phone her and help sort out the coding issue.\
I carried on transcribing the discussion video. Once I finished up I got ready and walked over to Brockley to meet my wife. As I got closer to the station I realised there were flying ants everywhere. I saw my wife at the pub, waving them away from her face. We got some drinks and the waitress brought them out, trying to dodge the ants around her head. They were everywhere, and everywhere you looked you saw people waving them away, slapping at the air and flicking them off their clothes and skin. They were crawling all over the floor. We laughed at the fact that this was the first time in weeks and weeks that we\'92d been out for a drink.\
We talked in depth about the job situation and my wife encouraged me to email my interviewers and ask to be considered for the other job.\
Back home I sent an email to the head of the school of art about the job, then made dinner and we ate outside. Then we went for a walk and sat and watched a huge group of women dancing to Candy by Cameo. When that finished, Incredible by General Levy came on, and they danced to that. There was a nice vibe in the park, quite relaxed and busy with people playing sports, not many people sitting about because it wasn\'92t that warm. More like the business end of the park user demographic.\

Thursday 5th August 2021\
 \
We went swimming and then walked home together. I had a shower, and when I got out I saw I had an email from the head of the school of art saying that they would consider me for both jobs, and that he thought he would have some good news for me the next day.\
I felt really good after my swim, and this made me feel pleased as well, though it was a bit strange - I felt it was perhaps a little unprofessional to hint that I might have got the job.\
I told my wife and we were happy, but she felt the same. We were both a bit worried about the implications of me getting the course leader job, but it was nice to know that they wanted me.\
I spent the whole day doing captions on the last long discussion video. I started the day with the good feeling of having aced the previous day\'92s interview, alongside the nice feeling of having been for a swim, but over the day I became very very bored with captioning. It seemed to be taking longer than the other videos, and felt, at times, physically painful. I did have a few good thoughts - one of them being about how captions could be used to erase nuance, or at least control the amount of nuance, the amount of detail in the textual information. Captions also made things funnier, somehow, the signposted things that were funny in a way that was helpful for deadpan, anti-comedy, or whatever kind of comedy these videos had.\
Apart from those thoughts, the day felt like a grind, and all the while I vaguely worried about the job. What would the commute be like? Would I be able to manage being a course leader? Would the students be shit? Would I get headaches from getting up early? Would I be able to manage my PhD on top of the new job?\
Alongside this, I realised I didn\'92t really know anything about what happened in full time academic jobs. Was there extra time for admin, or would I be teaching all the time? Was it crazy to assume I could do some of the job from home? What happened during the holidays? Was I expected to come into the art school? Could I work at home then?\
 \
Friday 6th August 2021\
 \
I slept badly. I knew the head of the school of art would call at some point in the morning but I didn\'92t know when. I wanted to make sure I answered, because the first part of my plan was to try and see if I could ask to have the other, two day a week job, and I didn\'92t want him to already have offered it to another candidate.\
My wife went to work and I nervously hung around. I didn\'92t go shopping - which I needed to, I didn\'92t go for a walk, I didn\'92t have a shower, I turned my phone on loud and worked on videos, and kept checking my phone.\
Eventually I had a shower, he didn\'92t phone. I got dressed, he didn\'92t phone. I was too nervous to have a caffeinated coffee, so I started making a pot of decaf coffee and then I heard my phone go.\
It was him. He offered me the course leader job. I tried to ask about the other job, but it was clear that it wasn\'92t on the table and that they had found someone for that. He said I could probably work from home for my admin time, and that he would put me in for the highest wage - 37K pro rate - as they didn\'92t pay university wages and he wanted to make sure I took the job. He even mentioned that it might be possible to teach one of my classes remotely. It all seemed good to me. I said that I would have a chat with my wife, and check with Kingston about PhD stuff, and then get back to him on Monday morning. He was a bit distracted, kept saying stuff about his girlfriend in Cambridgeshire, but he did send me the timetable for my whole year, which was helpful.\
I spent the rest of the day in a state of high anxiety and giddiness. I was excited that I\'92d got the job, but worried about all aspects of it. If I took it, it meant I couldn\'92t apply for any other jobs, even though there were a few I felt I might have a chance at getting.\
I went to Asda, then came home and ate lunch. I made a big coffee after lunch and worked on videos for the rest of the afternoon. The coffee made me feel more worried and on edge and when my wife got home I had a beer to calm down.\
We spoke about the job and decided I should do it. We would make it work, and even if I did it for one year, it would give me the experience to get another job, much more easily, in London. I phoned my parents and told them and they were very happy. My dad said it was amazing that I\'92d finally started my career, which I was semi-offended by, but it was just my dad being my dad. He didn\'92t mean anything bad, but he couldn\'92t help putting his foot in it.\
\
Monday 9th August 2021\
 \
I woke up and had breakfast, then walked down to Asda and bought some bits. Back home I had a shower and then phoned the head of the school of art to accept the job offer. When he answered it was clear that I\'92d woken him up. I felt a bit bad but it was 9:30 and I had said I was calling. We made a plan to speak on Thursday about the details. The other lecturer on the course had been appointed but he couldn\'92t remember her name so I couldn\'92t google her. I told him I\'92d email him a few things that I wanted to confirm about the job.\
I wrote an email to him confirming that I wanted to work from home for my admin time, that my wife was having a baby at the end of September and that I would have to take paternity leave even though it was right at the start of term, that I would need to move 3 admin days and two teaching days over the year to accommodate my PhD seminars, and that I would like to be able to teach some sessions online so that I didn\'92t have to commute for three days.\
I spent the day working on more videos. I was close to finishing. I had around 12 left to edit, and only a few of them required detailed work. Mostly they just needed a basic tidy up, keying, music and titles. I spent the morning making two videos: one of Daniel and one of Tammy googling things on their phones. I edited a few shots together, one a close up over the shoulder shot of them performing the googling, and one of them a fairly close shot from above and in front of them just tapping random stuff into their phone. I soundtracked it with an old, spacey ambient track I\'92d made a long time ago and put a background of early 90s rave visuals from Youtube that I found when I googled the word cyberspace. I liked the idea of the utopian, 90s vision of the web being the background to people googling \'91normal sized penis\'92 and \'91why am I so sad\'92.\
For lunch I made mac and cheese and had it with leftover roast tomatoes. I put out some washing on the clothes horse because it was meant to rain all afternoon. I washed the last of the baby clothes that we had bought, so now they were all clean and ready for the baby.\
After lunch I made two more videos of Daniel and Tammy. In the videos, each performer very slowly smiled, then grimaced until it became visibly uncomfortable for each of them. Over the top, my voice described the visible physiological event of laughter. It was a quote I\'92d found somewhere, and it was very technical and quite abstract - if you didn\'92t know it was about laughter you might not understand what was being described. I put the footage over an image of a police mugshot height chart background, and I used a shepherd\'92s tone - a set of tone generators that always sounded like it was ascending in pitch - for the music. I had to subtitle the VO so that took a bit of time, but for the second version with Tammy\'92s performance it took less time because I could just replace Daniel\'92s footage with hers, edit that and the music, and then render it out again.\
By this point in the day it had started to rain heavily. I lay on the couch and read some of the introduction of a book on Brecht but it seemed a bit like it wouldn\'92t be that relevant to me. I really needed some basic description of his techniques and ideas about his work. I went back to my third supervisor\'92s email about Brecht and realised that she\'92d recommended another book, by Brecht, with a very specific section in the book with him writing about his aesthetic. I found the book on aaaaarg.fail and downloaded it.\
My wife came back from work. She asked if I wanted to go to Wetherspoons and eat our favourite pub meal: lasagne and chips. I said maybe we should have a healthy meal and she got angry saying that I was refusing a pregnant woman her one treat. I said we could go but she said she didn\'92t want to now. Eventually I won her round.\
We went to the pub around 6:30. I felt nervous and anxious from having been inside all day on my own. I also didn\'92t want to drink alcohol. When we got inside the pub smelled a bit and it was loud and fairly busy with young people eating dinner and drinking and the locals wandering around, talking loudly to each other across the bar.\
We didn\'92t stay long after we\'92d eaten our food, which was tasty but a bit gross, as we had hoped and expected. At home I felt itchy and I wondered if there were fleas in the Wetherspoons seating, or perhaps I was allergic to some horrible ingredient in the lasagne. I felt irritable and anxious while writing my diary.\
 \
Tuesday 10th August 2021\
 \
We swam and I felt good and strong again. It was always amazing to me how much swimming realigned my thoughts and made me less anxious. I worked away at the last of the easy to make films.\
I made a film of me, Daniel and Tammy pretending to try and work out who was tallest. We stood lined up in front of the camera, rearranging ourselves as though we weren\'92t sure who was the tallest and who was shortest. I keyed the green screen out, which made me disappear, as I was wearing a green screen suit as I was in all of the videos. But then on a second track I made a mask that was kind of in the shape of my body in the film, and tracked it to me as I moved around on screen in my green screen suit and crocs. It ended up with this quite weird effect of the inflexible mask rotating, skewing and scaling up and down as I moved around, attached to me, but not actually following the movements of my arms and legs and body and head - as though there was a flat green mannequin attached to me.\
I put a high res image of a doctor\'92s office behind us, and because of some coincidence of scale and perspective and camera angle, the scene looked quite realistic. We looked a little bit like we were actually in the room, rather than (as in most of the other videos) clearly being in a green screen room with images edited in behind us.\
I made a video of the performers walking around in front of the camera looking amazed and put it over an edited video of the worst pictures of shitty gross bedrooms from 4chan. I put in a soundtrack of \'91Wow\'92 sound effects from YouTube that I found, pitched it down, then put subtitles on the video in the colours I had been using for the performer\'92s lines, giving the impression that they were saying wow, but they clearly weren\'92t because the wows on the soundtrack were kind of obviously not their voices and the voice changed with each, \'91Wow\'92 and sometimes were actually groups of people saying, \'91Wow\'92. I liked how you could imply something like that with norms, in this case of subtitling. It wasn\'92t that a viewer would believe it or be fooled because if they spent any time thinking about it they would notice that the voices saying, \'91Wow\'92 were not the performers\'92 voices. But no one would think about it, because it didn\'92t really matter.\
Then I had a kind of digressive thought about how if a viewer was deaf then by convention they would wrongly assume that the performers were saying wow, and that there was no discrepancy between the soundtrack and the dialogue and the captioning and in that sense they would actually be fooled by the video. So, in a way, the outcome was a very minor, slightly irritating joke on deaf people, only that wasn\'92t the intention, and I doubted whether deaf people would feel like it was either funny or cruel or even be bothered about it at all. My relationship with this work was very unique.\
Me and my wife ate lunch outside, then I carried on working. I made a quick video of the performers pointing at each other as though they were accusing the other of something, then made a longer video of the performers slapping each other. I slowed it right down, pitched down the sound and made it louder to make the slaps seem more powerful. I then edited in different images of boxing rings behind them, cutting to the next image when each slap connected with the performers\'92 faces. \
For the sound, I cut in audience reaction sound effects of laughing, cheering, booing and clapping each time one performer slapped the other, looping back through the sound effects in a slightly different order when I ran out. When I watched the video before rendering I realised that at first, everytime Tammy slapped Daniel, the audience laughed, and when Daniel slapped Tammy, they booed, or clapped or cheered. About halfway through the film, this swapped, so now when Tammy slapped Daniel the audience cheered, or clapped or booed, and when Daniel slapped Tammy, they laughed. \
I realised that I had been a bit worried when the audience were laughing at Tammy slapping Daniel as though they were laughing at Tammy for some reason? I didn\'92t know what. But then, when it switched, it felt like they were laughing at Tammy being hit. For some reason it put my mind at ease that it switched - like it had suddenly become a kind of weird satire on liberal forms of equal representation.\
My wife went out to meet a work friend. I recorded some monologues to edit over the final videos. I felt like I was ready to finish the videos, but couldn\'92t face doing the whole thing that day, so I promised myself that I would record and edit the voiceovers today, and do the final edits tomorrow. I had three videos where the performers just stared at the camera as my character delivered a monologue to them One of the monologues welcomed the performers to hell, one was about being \'91sizeblind\'92 (which was meant to be a bit like being \'91colour blind\'92 only with dwarfism instead of race) I decided to write a third voiceover about being a neurouniversalist. So, basically a rip off of the size blind idea, but applied to neurodivergency and neurotypicality. It was ok. Some funny bits, and a bit of alliteration that I liked. I recorded it even though I wasn\'92t sure whether it was good enough to use.t I could always decide not to use it.\
I decided to stop working and paint the coffee table. My wife had painted it twice now, but both colours had been a bit gross and had clashed with the sofa so we had some creamy white paint from her mum. I did one coat while listening to a podcast lecture about Plato\'92s ethics. I vaguely thought that I agreed with Plato - that poetry and art was corrupting and made people weak and feeble and immoral, but that was what I liked about it.\
I saw that the head of the school of art had sent me a Google Drive folder, so while I waited for the first coat of paint to dry I read through the documents: student timetables, timetables for me and the other people who taught on the course, module documents. I looked through the module documents but only a few of them had been filled out with actual lessons, and the lessons seemed quite vague for the studio practice modules, which were the bits that I really needed some guidance on. I read everything thoroughly and it was helpful but it made me feel as though I had a huge amount of work to do to prepare for the job but I didn\'92t know what work it was, and whether I\'92d be able to do it.\
My wife came back from her massage and said her back felt a lot better. I did the second coat of paint and when I was finished my wife came out into the garden to point out where I had left drips or applied an amount of paint that she thought was incorrect in some way.\
I made some greek food for dinner - beans with tomatoes and dill and a greek salad, plus some flatbreads with garlic butter. We ate in the garden. The weather had been nice all day for the first time in weeks. I felt a lot better after I ate. I had felt a bit panicky and anxious after reading the stuff the head of the school of art had sent through, but perhaps I had just been a bit hungry.\
 \
Wednesday 11th August 2021\
 \
I got up and had breakfast. My wife went to work and I got ready. I wasn\'92t sure I wanted to go for a walk but I wanted to go out and enjoy the day as it was sunny again.\
I decided to give the table a third coat. I listened to a podcast about Aristotle\'92s Poetics and then realised it was actually quite useful and that I should have been taking notes. I decided that I would go to the park and sit in the sun, listen to the podcasts and take some notes.\
In the park I put a rug down and laid down. It was nice to listen to the podcast, but taking notes was uncomfortable - I kept laying in different positions trying to be comfortable. I didn\'92t really mind because it was so nice to be in the sun, and also I was pleased that the lecture was so straightforward - basically just summarising Aristotle\'92s thoughts on tragedy, which I now realised was very specifically useful, or even fundamental, when thinking about emotions and art, because the whole thing was about why tragedy had value even though watching it was an experience that involved painful emotions of pity and fear.\
I finished the podcast, then sat for a while and thought about how I might not be able to be alone in this way for a while once we had a baby. I thought about how I was entering a new phase of my life. Maybe the second half, or maybe more like the second third, though I wasn\'92t expecting to live to 108. Anyway, the point was, I was starting a new phase, and it was scary, but good.\
I came back home and worked on the videos. After finishing a few of the introduction monologue videos I made a coffee, then came back upstairs and wrote up my Aristotle notes.\
In the afternoon I finished the final video. I mowed the lawn as it rendered, then came back upstairs and uploaded it to the Box folder. I matched up all the titles of the videos in the spreadsheet to the number of videos in the sub-folders online and counted that I had 118 videos, but when I checked the number of videos in the folder on my computer there were 121. I quickly saw a pre-render file that I took out, but after going through the list more slowly I couldn\'92t see any that were extra on my computer, or missing from the spreadsheet. I did note that I had been working on the videos since the 1st of July. I looked back through my calendar and guessed that it probably added up to about 22 full days of editing - once I\'92d taken off half days for applying for various jobs, or writing the presentations for my job interview, or going to meet some friends in the afternoon. I couldn\'92t help doing the sums in my head about and working out that at \'a3200 a day I would have been paid around \'a34000 for that if I had charged a day rate. I checked my budget and saw that I\'92d budgeted \'a3800 for editing - though I would pay myself for the camera operating which was another \'a3600, and then I would also pay myself for those days as a performer so that was another \'a31200 - so \'a32600 overall, which seemed more than fair really, as no one had asked me to make 118 videos (or 120, or whatever).\
I took my Kindle to the park to read an essay about Brecht. I messaged my wife and told her that I was in the park but she said she was driving to pick up a baby gym that she\'92d seen on Facebook marketplace.\
I laid in the park, reading my book, making notes, and occasionally looking around at teeangers playing football, some cricketers setting up a batting net and a group of little kids doing karate. I thought about how I had lots of anxiety, but it felt like energy or something, coursing through me, sometimes, and other times like a kind of looming shadow. Sometimes I was anxious and I didn\'92t mind it, and sometimes I was scared of it, but I was never not anxious. I wondered - and kind of knew the answer was no - whether there were drugs for anxiety that didn\'92t also do other stuff that was ultimately bad for you. I didn\'92t want to be dulled, or made stupid, or depressed or whatever else might happen with medication.\
\
Thursday 12th August 2021\
 \
We went swimming. When we came home I read about animals and performance art in a journal recommended by my performer. I had thought I might write an essay about animals in art and status and emotions; animals as proxies for human feelings and relations to animals as proxies for human relations to other humans. I read and took notes. I learned about dogs in Elizabethan theatre, about various dogs and becoming-dogs in performances in modern and contemporary art.\
I had a coffee and then read more. I read about Forced Entertainment\'92s use of animal costumes, about their pathetic comedy, their freaky passivity. How they became excellent listeners. I thought about how animals couldn\'92t speak, and how that\'92s why we made them speak for us, or we spoke through them.\
At 2 I had a Zoom meeting with the head of the school of art. I met my colleague - a sculptor and video maker who was going to be the tutor for the second year. The head of the art school ran through writing a module guide, which was very useful information. It turned out we had to produce these module guides before our official start date of September. That annoyed me, but I supposed that was just the way it was.\
The other lecturer seemed nice. She had a strong Essex accent which I thought was nice but also surprising. But maybe I would be the outlier, my Essex accent worn away by years of metropolitan middle class assimilation. I would be apologetic for my city status, just as I had been for my bumpkin naivety and muttering monotone voice when I had arrived in Newcastle from Essex for university.\
Afterwards me and the head of the school of art ran through a few things. It turned out I wasn\'92t eligible for paternity leave but he said I would take the time off unpaid. We agreed about working from home, and he talked me through the holiday allowance and how that all worked, then talked about how he had hired me for my enthusiasm rather than my experience. He said there had been another candidate who had plenty of experience but had sent him and the other interviewer to sleep. He said he would try to arrange a handover meeting between me and my predecessor and he said he would try to send the old module guides for the modules I was teaching.\
After the meeting I felt stressed out and overwhelmed, but also bored and tired, which was a feeling I hadn\'92t had for a long time - a depressing, headachy feeling that I associated with school and with an office job I had done as a student.\
My wife had gone to the doctors to get her first vaccine and when she came back I moaned about the job. She took some paracetamol like the nurse had told her and then we went through my timetable for the year, talking about holidays and when I might be able to work from home. I said I didn\'92t want a job, I just wanted to do my PhD and hang out with my baby. I didn\'92t like jobs.\
My wife went out to meet her pregnant women group in the park. I sat in the garden and read my Brecht book and drank two beers. After the first beer I felt a bit calmer about the job. I\'92d just have to write the module guides, and then I\'92d have to write the sessions, and then I\'92d have to carry on doing that for a year.\
I messaged Andrea and asked if I could buy her lunch and we could brainstorm the module guides. She got back and said she was up for that, but I left it at that because she said she was on the bus home from having done two workshops with two different groups in one day, fantasising about cold pasta she had in her fridge. I left her to her dinner.\
I ate some dinner, then my wife came back and ate hers. We chatted about her pregnant lady group. They had talked about induction (according to the people in the group who had been inducted it wasn\'92t as bad as people had thought, or it was much worse), vaginal discharge (getting worse, more) and diet (tending toward junk food).\
I\'92m here\

 \
Tuesday 17th August 2021\
 \
We went swimming and then went to Sainsburys to get some dental floss. I could only get the shitty ribbon floss. We were both wearing plasticky shoes and it was raining. We walked carefully but I still slipped twice on the shiny pavement slabs by the new build flats.\
I spoke to Claire about the styling for the web version of the work. The work had to have some kind of introduction screen because lots of internet browsers didn\'92t allow you to autoplay videos with sound before someone had clicked something on the screen. We agreed that she would try lots of different fonts and animation styles, basically making the intro text look as ugly as possible. Then I zoomed with an HR person from Colchester Institute where I held up some ID so she could see it was me. Then she sent me a link to do a DBS check. She told me she would get the contract over to me by the end of the week. \
I drank a coffee and read bell hooks. Then I put the washing out. It was cold and drizzling outside so I used the clothes horse and put it by the window.\
After lunch I spent some time putting together my notes from bell hooks into a new order and putting them alongside a slideshow of headings with terms like recognition, difference, responsibility, discipline, community and praxis. I didn\'92t quite know if it might be a bit much all at once, but maybe I could work on it a bit more and it would be a good way of introducing ourselves to each other. Maybe.\
My wife asked if I wanted to go to Ikea to buy some storage and some frames. I didn\'92t want to go to Ikea, but I agreed to go. We measured the shelves where we wanted some storage and then got ready to go. I told my wife it would take 30 minutes to get there because it was rush hour and she got annoyed at me and said she was tired and I was being annoying.\
We drove into the traffic in Lewisham and sat there for a long time. My wife said something derogatory about my driving and we had an argument. We sat in silence for the rest of the journey. We always argued on the way to Ikea.\
We made up once we got to Ikea, walked around and got our storage and frames and a few bits. We also got some Daim chocolates which seemed great but when we got out to the car we realised they were just really expensive small bits of Daim. Things seemed cheap in Ikea, but they weren't.\
 \
Wednesday 18th August 2021\
 \
I worked in the morning and then went to see Andrea to talk about writing my modules for the new job. I got the train to London Bridge, then walked towards Maltby Street restaurant. I saw her outside, loaded with bags. She had a picnic blanket, and she\'92d printed out the module guides that I\'92d sent her and arranged them inside a neat little binder. I bought us an egg mayo sandwich, a caesar chicken sandwich, a little cheese tart and an apricot tart for dessert. She bought some wine, which I thought she was taking home, but then she asked for it to be opened and I realised she had bought it for our picnic. Her wine probably cost more than the lunch I had bought. I said that I couldn\'92t drink as I was driving back to Suffolk that evening. Maybe I could have a very small glass.\
We walked to a park and sat on the blanket and ate. I drank my very small class of expensive wine and we ate our sandwiches. We got stuck into talking about how to teach first year art students. I pushed Andrea on certain examples, asking exactly what her role had been in different lessons that she\'92d taught. We spoke more about abstract approaches to teaching. Like what exactly you were teaching when you taught art. Andrea\'92s view was that you always had the lesson and then a kind of meta-lesson - like, you were going to make some collaborative work, but the meta-lesson was to help students realise that they could work collaboratively, or that working collaboratively could be part of how they made their individual work. Or, you were having a group crit, but the meta-lesson was to learn to speak and listen  together about artworks. Her view was that you had to tell the students about both of the lessons - you couldn\'92t and shouldn\'92t hide what the point of doing something really was. That was stupid.\
Andrea told me about the A course, which had been an experimental sculpture and performance course at CSM in the 80s. The students were asked to do very specific things by the tutors. Very specific and kind of strange things. Almost like tests or experiments, but with an expansive hypothetical learning outcome. Like they would get a letter telling them to buy particular materials and make something out of them. Or they would get a letter telling them that they had to occupy a little raised area in the studios for a certain length of time.\
I asked Andrea what she would do if she were designing a first year art module. She gave me examples of things she thought were important. Mostly it was about getting them out of school mode. She gave all her students \'91Anassignment Letters\'92, which was an essay by Fred Moten about how assignments were a bit shit. Andrea thought that being an artist at art school was about articulating what you were doing - clarifying, rather than justifying. Justification was something students learned at school - justifying their use of a material or an aesthetic decision by telling you the authority that allowed them to do it: the artist who also used a material, or how a certain decision related to a chosen theme. Clarifying was about being able to investigate something on demand, if you wanted or needed to. Not all decisions needed to be clarified, or be articulated, but one of the most important skills for an artist was to be able to undertake that process of clarifying and articulating if required. Of course, at art school, the requirement could be formalised and externalised, but the aim was to make the possibility of requiring (or not) articulation an internal one. I.e., we weren't just teaching them to explain themselves to others, but to instigate that requirement of themselves as a method of developing their ideas or ways of working.\
We talked about object lessons - like materials boxes, and a pedagogy technique from preschool where teachers got students to talk about the very basic qualities of an object together. It reminded me of group crits that I ran where I tried to undercut students\'92 tendencies to talk about symbolism or meaning straight away by getting them to tell everyone what we were seeing in front of our eyes - like, what was the material stuff we were looking at? I thought that was a good lesson and a way of getting them to start talking about things - whether they were art things or not.\
We finished up and said our goodbyes. Andrea recommended a few more people to look up: ceramic artists who did interesting stuff, and some art educators who had a good instagram with lots of quick, fun experimental ways of making objects and images.\
I came home on the train and my wife messaged saying that she\'92d found a nice dining room table with chairs that we could buy from just round the corner from our house. We drove round - literally less than a minute away from our house and picked up a nice table and chairs. The couple who were selling it had a nice house, and they\'92d just had their second baby. The woman shared some details of the birth with my wife and we spoke about babies for a bit.\
We managed to fit all the chairs and tabletop in the car, and then I walked holding the frame and legs around me like a kind of weird outfit. It was nice to walk home with cars driving past me, as though I was an art student doing a first year performance.\

 \
We drove back to my wife\'92s mum\'92s house. The weather swung from shitty to less shitty all day. I uploaded the last video for the performance to camera work and then worked on my first year module guide using the notes I\'92d taken from my meeting with Andrea. I felt a bit more confident about doing a few things differently. I changed a few things on the bibliography and added a few more informally worded parts to try and cut through the bureaucratic stylings of the pro forma template for the document.\
That evening my wife went out with her friends so I drove over to have dinner with my dad. My mum was there when I got there but she left to go to pilates. Me and my dad had a beef stir fry that he\'92d made that didn\'92t taste of much. Then we ate ice creams and walked around the garden while he told me about a gravel base he was making upon which he was constructing a shed. It sounded a bit complex to me. I told him I thought he should just use paving slabs underneath the shed, but he looked at me like I was trying to trick him.\
After dinner I drove back to my wife\'92s mum\'92s house, listening to music on my phone through the car stereo. I hadn\'92t done it before and I was happy that I got it to work, but I couldn\'92t really skip songs while I drove, so when a dubstep remix of Blinded by the Lights by the Streets came on I couldn\'92t do anything about it.\

 \
It was the launch day of the website version of In Hell (which is what the performance to camera work was now called). I got up and got ready. My wife went to work. I took a shit, and when I wiped my bum I somehow cricked my neck. I heard something pop and it was painful.\
When I came home I drank a coffee and posted about the website on social media, then sent individual emails to people I thought might be interested in the work.\
At 11 I had a meeting with the lecturer who had examined me at my upgrade. She told me all about Performance Philosophy, which was a network of researchers looking at performance and philosophy and also a peer reviewed journal. Then we talked about TaPRA which was the Theatre and Performance Research Association. The lecturer was the co-convenor of the philosophy and performance working group for TaPRA and helped organise their talks at the TaPRA conference every year. It was too late for me to be able to attend the online conference, even though it wasn\'92t for another few weeks. Finally we talked about Performance Research which was a very well respected journal that had been going for years, but it wasn\'92t peer reviewed and the articles were shorter so it wasn\'92t as reffable as Performance Philosophy. After the meeting I read an article by the lecturer in Performance Research then had lunch.\
After lunch I zoomed with Rob the coder about the raspberry pi version of In Hell for the exhibition. We got all the details sorted for that, then talked about a text work I wanted him to make where I gave him a huge corpus of text and he coded it to randomly re-combine in 20 word chunks in different fonts, scrolling over a background of colour changing gradients. He had a few issues he needed to check, but he reckoned he could do it. He told me what he needed from me and we chatted for a bit and then finished the call.\
The website artwork was getting some good feedback online and a few people had responded to my emails saying nice things. I did all the things I needed to do for the coder, then responded to the emails. By the time I\'92d finished my emails my wife was home.\
That night it was the final of Love Island. Summer felt like it was over. That meant the new job would start soon, the baby would come soon, our old lives would be over and our new lives would begin.\
 \
Wednesday 25th August 2021\
I worked at home all day. In the afternoon I spoke to Jeno, the exhibition producer that Kingsgate had hired to help do my show. He seemed really nice and switched on. He had just graduated from Goldsmiths, but he had taken a few years out in between his second and third years. We spoke about the TVs and he reckoned he could make a nice sloping shelf for a CRT monitor, and when I said about getting hold of an armchair he suggested Facebook marketplace. I felt like I trusted him and that he would be able to do the job well.\

I went to Hoxton to meet Volker, my second supervisor. He bought a cup of tea and I bought a coffee and then we walked to Haggerston Park. As we walked through the park we heard a woman shouting. We looked over, across a playing field and over a low fence, and saw her running. She was shouting for help, and shouting that someone had just stolen her phone. We stopped speaking, but could not do anything to help. In a few seconds she had run out of sight behind a building, chasing the robber who we had never seen. A man came out of the building, drawn by the shouting, but he couldn\'92t even see the woman whose cries he had heard. He stood in the sunlight for a second, looking dazed. We turned back to the path and the woman in front of us turned around and told us that the woman had just had her phone stolen.\
We had our supervision session on a bench in the middle of the park. Volker didn\'92t seem too phased by me having a baby, or getting a job. He liked the video work I\'92d sent him and we talked about it. We talked about the embarrassment of performance art. He had studied in Vienna, so the Viennese Aktionnists had always been embarrassing figures to him, but when he had arrived in London people had referred to them as if they were radical. I told him that for me they\'92d always just existed as black and white photos in art history books, or digital videos on ubuweb and it had seemed pretty great, when I had first discovered their work, that they had shit everywhere and sprayed blood on their audience. But then, I had always looked for grotesque humour as part of my adolescent avant gardism, so it was fine to me that it was also kind of cringeworthy, or that later they had gone all weird and bloated and a bit operatic.\

We worked at my wife\'92s mum\'92s house. I had a really nice supervision session with Dan. We covered the same ground as I had with my second supervisor, but talked a lot about 90s video art. He was saying that his generation and the generation of artists he liked from the 2000s had generally gone back to the radical cinema and experimental film of the 70s, avoiding what they saw as the banal and meaningless notion of \'91artists moving image\'92 that was associated with the 90s/00s video art installation boom. That got me excited, because it made me think that I was maybe doing something new by valuing all the shittiest parts of 90s video art, or at least re-evaluating what was generally thought to be excessive, crass and redundant in 90s video art.\
I read out a list of possible essay topics and he got excited about it - how it could be a format for writing, i.e., how the expanded list might be a good format for the written element of my PhD. That was good - we seemed to be getting closer to having an idea of what exactly I was putting together.\
I spent the rest of the day re-reading and editing a piece I\'92d started that might one day end up as the introduction to my thesis. I felt positive that I could do the PhD alongside the job, and the baby. At the same time, I felt this was incredibly naive. I would only know once the baby came.\

I was officially at work, but I was working at home. In the morning I sent my module guides through the head of the school of art and thought about my first lesson with the students. There was so much to find out about them, but also quite a lot of administrative information to go through. And probably quite a lot of things that I wanted to get across to them. It was a lot to try and fit in one session.\
In the afternoon I got an email from Colchester Institute asking me to complete four different online training courses. Health and Safety, Safeguarding, Equality and Diversity and GDPR. I decided to go through them as fast as I could. Well, not as fast as I could. I took my time with the safeguarding training as that was new to me, but with all the others I rushed through them. Some sessions were meant to take around 1.5 hrs but I got through them in 25 minutes. There were tests at the end, but they were multiple choice and I ended up with a 90-97% pass rate for them. The courses were very boring but the animated illustrations were funny - almost intentionally surreal with a kind of English bawdiness to them, somehow, the way the icons pulsed and throbbed. The foreshortened perspective in the illustrations gave a grimacing comic edge to a guy tripping over and spilling his coffee, or a diverse group of students and staff surrounded by bouncing green ticks.\
I did the prevent training last, but it was provided by an external organisation and it took me ages to set up an account. Finally a support email came through saying that they had manually verified my account. My wife and her mum and her brother\'92s girlfriend had gone out to a second hand baby clothes shop so I rushed to finish it before they got home. It was fairly grim - the idea that I was having to police my students for anti-British values. The training at least did pay lip service to far right extremism being part of the terror threat they were asking us to look out for.\

 \
I had organised a drink with Daniel and Tammy, but Daniel had cancelled a few days before, so then I\'92d organised a drink with the singer and the bassist from my band, but then Daniel had uncancelled and Tammy had also said they could meet for a quick drink, so we organised to meet at Brockley at 6:30.\
Daniel ordered a mimosa which seemed really exciting and great, but I ordered a beer as I was without imagination and also didn\'92t like the idea of running out of something to drink. Daniel had cut off all his hair after we had finished filming. He looked quite neat, without his bushy beard and long hair. Tammy told us that they had received a kind of open offer of support from the Battersea Arts Centre. Basically, whenever they wanted to do something they would find money for her, rehearsal space, and production support. I was really happy for them and was amazed at the generosity of the offer. I didn\'92t even know that kind of thing happened. Daniel I could tell, felt a bit weird and jealous and sad. He had previously made a joke about no one wanting to work with him. It didn\'92t affect me as much because that wasn\'92t my world - the Battersea Arts Centre wouldn\'92t have a clue who I was.\

It was Open House weekend and there were guided walks around the Brockley Mews. We didn\'92t want to go on a guided walk, but we thought we would get the map and walk around the Mews. In the end, the girl at the pub, which was the meeting point, knew nothing about any guided walk or map, so we just walked up and down the mews. There were three of them. In the first two, there were fancy houses, where people had bought up garages, knocked them down, and built modern houses. In the very first one, we saw the owner of a big fancy house pull out of the mews in a gold Mercedes. I hated rich people, especially extravagant rich people who liked owning things that made them appear rich. I I didn\'92t like that it riled me up. I felt like it confirmed the hierarchical relationship between me and them. The rest of the mews in general were a mix of big sheds at the end of fancy gardens, or old lockups and garages. Some abandoned cars, and some overgrown lots.\
The second mews had a big bus where someone lived. There were posters up asking people to sign a petition against some development plans which would make him move his bus. I imagined people were sympathetic, but it seemed inevitable that the rich people who owned the land would beat a man who illegally camped on their land in a bus.\
  Eventually we got to a community gardens where we spoke to some people about the mews. Apparently the abandoned cars we\'92d seen were a protest by a man who had wanted to extend his big coach house conversion, but the council had refused his planning permission because there was a protected tree, so he\'92d dumped a load of cars on the land, which was a weird way to protest, as it wouldn\'92t do anything, and as the lady pointed out, no one saw it apart from his neighbours and local resident who walked their dogs through the mews. The cars had been there for 12 years now, she said.\
The lady asked about the baby and my wife rubbed her belly and told her it was due in three weeks. Then we talked about the community garden and the ever present threat of snails. The lady said that a fellow gardener went out at night with a headlamp and a pair of scissors. There was an audible gasp from the group when she said scissors. It was quite a visceral image.\

I spent the day feeling good about my first day of work, emailing and texting Jeno about the Kingsgate show, and reading Sianne Ngai\'92s essay \'91Merely Interesting\'92. I noted a lot of connections between her analysis of the aesthetic category of the interesting, and Peter Osborne\'92s art historical/philosophical analysis of conceptual art and its postconceptual legacy. In different ways they both pertained to the artist somehow incorporating the position of the critic in their work. In a way, the conceptual legacy was a kind of restructuring of the roles of artist, critic and spectator, in which the artist - willingly or not - has to do all those jobs at the same time. In different ways, they both talked about conceptual art as art that indexes or was constituted by post-fordist capitalism.\

 \
I spent the whole day stressing out. First, Rob rang and told me that the raspberry pi version of my video work wasn\'92t working and that he would have to send me some code and the files to put onto a mac mini at the gallery. I sent an email to Jeno at the gallery and explained what was going on.\
I was late for swimming, and only one lane was open because there were swimming lessons, so that lane was very busy and it wasn\'92t a very restful swimming experience.\
I didn\'92t feel very relaxed after swimming, and though I spent the morning reading Sianne Ngai, it wasn\'92t very pleasant - I felt as though I had many other things pressing on my mind.\
In the evening I made red braised pork for us and drank white wine until I felt less stressed out. It had been my wife\'92s last day of work. Now she was officially on maternity leave. We talked about how weird it was that she wouldn\'92t go back to work for a year. She said she was glad to be leaving. Everyone was stressed out and the charity seemed to be imploding after a stressful year and a half. Staff were very depressed about the situation and the pressure they were being put under to keep the charity going, with no reward in terms of pay or benefits.\
 \
Saturday 11th September 2021\
 \
The coder rang me in the morning saying that he\'92d managed to fix the problem with the raspberry pi. That was good news. He said he would send it special delivery to the gallery so it would get there in time for the show. We agreed that he would still send over the program and the files for the mac mini, just in case we needed it.\
I drove to Asda and did the shopping, then came back and cleaned the house. We got ready and then walked around Brockley because there was a Brockley Society sponsored event that weekend where people were doing yard sales out of their gardens. We walked around the posh bit and I felt very middle class. Rich women kept talking to us about our unborn child and I felt like we were being inducted into a secret club of posh white people with children. I bought a little book of Hieronymous Bosch pictures.\
I left at 5 to get to Finsbury Park for my friend\'92s birthday. I felt like I offended one of his friends early on, and then spent the rest of the evening trying to be as nice as possible. I enjoyed the evening but felt as though I couldn\'92t trust myself around people I felt to be sensitive or delicate when I\'92d had a drink. I wasn\'92t very comfortable with offending people anymore, and yet I couldn\'92t help challenging people when I thought they were wrong or misguided in what they were saying. Perhaps it was my manner. Maybe it was the stress of the job and the incoming baby. I wished I didn\'92t have the job and that I could just be worrying about the baby rather than having to worry about all the things at once.\
\
Tuesday 14th September 2021\
 \
I got up, got ready and went to the studio. It was raining very hard and I was wet by the time I got to the studio. I made a box for my sculptures, rolled the drawings and covered them in bin bags, and wrapped the tile painting in a rug.\
I took all the stuff to the front of the studio, then ordered a taxi. It didn\'92t come into the car park, so I had to do two trips carrying my stuff across the main road to the side street by Sainsbury\'92s\
I got to the gallery at 10:30, arriving at the same time as Jeno. I brought my stuff in, drank some coffee from my flask, and we started testing the raspberry pi computers with the video and text works on. After a bit of fiddling we got both of them working on the flatscreen TV. We didn\'92t have the cable to connect it to the big Sony Cube so we couldn\'92t test it on that, but I messaged Rob and told him it seemed to be working. He was pleased.\
I started arranging the works in the space, leaning the sculptures up against their respective walls, laying out the drawings to flatten out a bit.\
After lunch the wood got delivered for Jeno to make a shelf for the TV to go on. He went to the office to get something and came back holding a shonky looking scart cable with RGB leads coming out. That was what we needed to attach the raspberry pi to the cube so I plugged it in. At first it wasn\'92t working, but then the video came on. The right speaker wasn\'92t working, so I fiddled around a bit, and eventually pushed the scart cable in a bit more. The TV turned off, all the lights went off on the front, and a bad smell rose up from the plastic grating in the outer cover. It had definitely just blown.\
I told Jeno and he looked very nervous. I said we should phone the rental company and tell them but not tell them about the shonky looking scart lead. He said it couldn\'92t have been the lead as it doesn\'92t carry any charge. I wasn\'92t so sure. I messaged Roband he said the same thing as Jeno, and then when I googled it, that was also the consensus - that a lead couldn\'92t really blow a telly because it carried information rather than electricity.\
Jeno spent the afternoon building the shelf, and I made some decisions about the big drawings and started hanging them on big bits of nylon rope, tied messily with slipknots to big screws high up on the wall. They looked good but I wanted to try and make the bottoms of the drawings hang straight down, rather than curving around towards the wall.\
We finished for the day and I tried to reassure Jeno about the TV. it would be fine, we would get a new telly and they would never be able to prove that we did anything wrong.\
I went and got us a beer and we sat outside in the back garden talking about Welsh nationalism and the new age movement. Jeno felt that Welsh ecology was mostly the preserve of English incomers - hippies who\'92d moved there to start organic farms in the 70s.\
I left around 7 and got the tube home. It was dark when I got back to Brockley and it felt like autumn.\
At home my wife had made us a nice squash and chickpea stew and we watched a documentary about the Spice Girls. Every now and again the sound would fade from a clip of a Spice Girls music video, and the clip would go slow-mo and a piece of ambient electronic music would fade in as though it was an Adam Curtis film.\

Friday 17th September 2021\
 \
I went up to Kingsgate. When I got to Hampstead I saw the director, Dan and we walked to the gallery together. He let me into the gallery and then he went over to the office. The gallery floor had been painted but parts of it were still a bit sticky. It looked good. Jeno had messaged me the day before to say that the TV was working fine and that made me pleased.\
Jeno arrived and we set the TV plinth/shelf thing up. The tech had brought a friend along to help with the show and also to help him put up a billboard by another artist that was being installed up on the wall of the gallery. They cut some holes in the plinth and then secured the TV onto it with cable ties. I installed the raspberry pis and put the cables and adaptors in. Everything worked. I positioned the reclining chair in front of the TV. Then I decided on the position of the screen for the text work. Then I took all the drawings down, one by one, and took them outside in the sun. I sprayed them with 3 coats of UV varnish, then took them back in and attached them to their bulldog clips.\
Jeno and his friend had the ladder so I couldn\'92t re-hang the drawings at the correct heights. Instead, I attached strips of wood to the bottom of the drawings so they hung straight and flat. They looked a lot better then with the edges all curled back.\
I went for lunch. I went to a Turkish place and ordered a shish kebab with rice and salad. It was a tenner but I was having a hard week so I thought I deserved it. When I got the food it was in a huge box, with extra bread and sauces. I went to the park near the gallery and sat on a bench. I ate about half of the food while listening to some tramps argue. Eventually one of the tramps stormed away shouting.\
At one point some chinese women, led by a different tramp holding a knife, climbed over the low fence and started cutting flowers from a rose bush. The women selected the flowers they wanted, and the tramp did the cutting.\
I went back to the gallery, and spent the the afternoon hanging the drawings, then we cleared the gallery and Jeno and his friend mopped the floor. I did a bit of hoovering and moved some furniture around on the terrace out the back\
Mary the gallery manager came down with a list of works and an exhibition handout with some text. The text looked good to me.\
I got changed into some clean clothes and then suddenly it was 6pm and we were drinking beers on the terrace, waiting for people to turn up.\
The first visitor was a weird posh guy who either wasn\'92t able to meet anyone\'92s eye, or had a lazy eye. He came straight over to me and started talking. He spoke non-stop, about Nietzsche, about Hitler, about cancel culture and statues. He wasn\'92t aggressive or scary, but he sounded like an old man, like a thwarted old man. Then he started telling me about his phone.\
I said goodbye and went inside the exhibition. I filmed a little video to show my wife the exhibition then sent it to her. Some friends arrived, then other people I didn\'92t know. Then suddenly the terrace was full and it was getting dark and people were drunk and lots of friends were with me. I kept being stuck with people who I knew, but who weren\'92t really close friends: a PhD colleague, someone I knew from when I worked at an auction house. The posh guy came back for a while. I kept seeing close friends who smiled and waved but then went into the gallery and left me with the people I didn\'92t know that well.\
Eventually, I started being a bit more decisive, moving around and making sure I spoke to people - some who I hadn\'92t seen since lockdown, and in the back of my mind, knowing I wouldn\'92t see them for a while after having the baby.\
It was time to go. Tammy said they were going to the pub but I said I wouldn\'92t join them. I got my bag from the office and walked with them but then left them at the pub and got on the tube.\

 \
We got up and went for a swim. It was busier. We thought maybe they\'92d started letting more people book slots on the app. It used to be that you could just turn up and buy a ticket and walk in, but maybe since they\'92d reopened after Corona they were more popular and they\'92d never go back to that.\
We bought some celery, chocolate, bananas, carrots and a tiny bottle of baby formula. When we got home my wife had a tuna sandwich and as she ate it she said that she had nothing else planned for the whole day.\
I made coffee and read the end of the Sianne Ngai Merely Interesting essay, where Ngai talked about the pedagogical and political aspects of the interesting as an aesthetic category. The way I understood it, claims of interestingness were performative invitations to discuss a cultural object further, to attain more information and engage in conversation around the object and its interestingness. Disagreement was possible and invited - very different to aesthetic judgements of the beautiful which were emphatic and final. And, the political aspects of it - slight as they were - were about opening up specialised knowledge to outsider interest. The way Ngai put it was that it was associated with a Habermasian opening up of the public sphere.\
In the afternoon I found a section of Adorno\'92s Aesthetic Theory about ugliness and spent the rest of the afternoon reading that. It was very dense, but interesting. In the bit I read, he was saying that ideas of beauty came from ideas of ugliness that came from archaic uses of art as tools in which terrifying or horrifying figures needed to be conjured up through representation for ritualistic religious reasons. We banished the terrifying, and these things became merely ugly, and we strove for beauty. There was loads of stuff I didn\'92t really get, and I wished he\'92d put more paragraph breaks in.\
I started making dinner, then gave my wife a neck massage. Then I poured us diet cokes and my wife watched Come Dine With Me and I made dinner. We had cannellini beans with dill and garlic croutons. I was a bit irritated that it didn\'92t taste of much, but my wife said she liked it. I kept adding more things - salad leaves, chopped tomatoes, a squeeze of lemon, but it still tasted a bit claggy and bland. Me and my wife spoke about her fear of being induced, of not going into labour at home. I tried to remind her that it was her decision if and when she was induced. We were worried about the maternity ward, whether there would be enough midwives. We\'92d heard a big report on the news about how dangerous it was for women giving birth.\
 \
Friday 24th September 2021\
 \
I spent the day reading Adorno and feeling anxious. I hadn\'92t gone swimming and that put me in a weird mood. In the afternoon I went out to the park and sat in the sun reading, which made me feel better, but I only really relaxed when I had a can of beer later. I slept badly and cricked my back in the morning. I did manage to write quite a lot of notes from the Adorno essay and found out that he didn\'92t like Jazz, or he thought fans of jazz were unsophisticated in the way they always preferred what was new. I couldn\'92t actually tell whether this was him implying that jazz itself was unsophisticated.\
 \
Sunday 26th September 2021\
 \
My wife told me that apparently the 26th of September was the most popular birthday which made me laugh, as though people chose their own birthdays, but I knew what she meant. We were due to give birth in the busiest time of year, during a baby boom and an NHS staff shortage caused by covid and Brexit.\
\
Tuesday 28th September 2021\
 \
No baby. I went swimming but felt tired, had a headache and needed a poo. I got out after about 25 minutes and went home. On the way there and back I listened to Sara Ahmed talking about complaints. I kept noticing myself getting annoyed at her, or the women she was quoting, or feeling weird empathy for the harassers or abusers she spoke about. It was only when she mentioned the actual instances of assault or harassment that I realised she was talking about quite extreme things: emails with sexual content, pushing students or colleagues up against doors to try to kiss them. I wondered if part of the male reaction against feminist calls for action on violence and harassment against women was that we kind of all felt like we could be potential abusers or harassers, because we didn\'92t really realise what people were being accused of. The notion of a culture where you were cancelled for holding a door open for a woman or whatever was easier to comprehend than the fact that many men were willing and able to physically assault women at their own workplace, or send a colleague dick pics or whatever. Like, basically, men were so worried that we would make some error of etiquette and get fired for asking a student if she had a nice weekend that we didn\'92t actually notice the content of the real abuses of power.\
In the conversation after the lecture Ahmed mentioned the notion of non-performativity in which institutions made official utterances in order not to have them have any effect. I made a note in my phone to look up which book that was in.\
At home I had a shower then made a coffee. Once I\'92d had a poo and a coffee I felt a bit better. My headache cleared and I didn\'92t feel as tired. I did a few emails and read the end of the Adorno bit on beauty and ugliness. Sometimes I didn\'92t know what he was talking about, but I liked the idea that beauty might be a response to ugliness, or like, ugliness might come before beauty in the history of art. This idea that archaic art was images of terrifying things made for ritual actions to dispel the fear of the unbounded world, then once we disenchant the world, we reappraise these objects as ugly, and formulate the idea of beauty in response.\
My wife was in bed. I asked her if she was going to go for a walk around the park, just so she was upright and not laying down all day. She joked about having the baby while she was out in the rain.\
We had lunch and then my wife went out for a bit while it was sunnier and not raining. I found a Claire Bishop essay about the black box and the white cube and performance in museums and read that. I\'92d actually been wanting to read writing around the information theory version of the black box - a system in which inputs and outputs were readable, but the process in between was not visible to an observer. It felt like it was related to the way that the two versions of In Hell were coded and that their processes, though relatively simple, were as obscure to me as they were to the viewer. But I\'92d totally forgotten about the idea of a black box theatre, which was so essential to the history of performance and experimental theatre.\
I looked at my computer and saw that Eirini Katsaki, a performer and writer I\'92d emailed had gotten back to me saying she was happy to write something about In Hell. While I made dinner and my wife had a bath I sent her lots of information and some texts that had accumulated while I had made the work.\
 \
 \
Friday 1st October 2021\
 \
I spent the morning reading an essay by Emma Bennett on Stewart Lee. Eirini had said that Emma Bennett was writing a book about direct address and had sent me through the book she had edited that Bennett had contributed to.\
While reading the essay I formalised an idea for something I could write: about tautologies, repetition, time, re-iteration and performativity.\
 \
Thursday 7th October 2021\
\
In the delivery suite at Lewisham my wife\'92s contractions were intense. We tried to get her in the shower to help with the pain but it wouldn\'92t work. I called for the midwife who also couldn\'92t get it to work and left us on our own while she went to find someone to help. While she was out of the room the shower suddenly turned on and started spraying everywhere. She must have left the faucet open. I laughed, one of the few times I laughed, at how insane the situation was. I took my socks off and rolled up my trousers and went into the bathroom to adjust the shower head, turn it down, and get the right temperature. My wife undressed and got in the shower. She sat on the little disabled person seat in there and we moved the shower from her belly to her back, over and over again. Every now and again I worried about how hot the water was, whether it might hurt the baby or stall the labour.\
  Eventually my wife got out of the shower and got back in the chair. She started saying that she didn\'92t know what to do and she didn\'92t think she could make it. She was panicking. The midwife came in so I asked her for a cup of tea and some more codeine for my wife, hoping that it would take the edge off her contractions.\
  Eventually we got into a manageable rhythm with the TENS machine and the gas and air so that my wife could get through the contractions one at a time. Her eyes were mostly closed. She was in a lot of pain.\
  At a certain point two women identifying themselves only as doctors came in and suggested that my wife had pethidine. Of all the pain killers this one was our least preferred because it crossed the placenta into the baby\'92s body. They didn\'92t really say why they thought she should have pethidine or explain anything about it.\
  Later they came back in and my wife was really in pain and she asked for an epidural. They said they would start the process of getting her an epidural and also call the anaesthetist to come and speak to us. The doctors came back and said they were worried about the baby\'92s heart rate but they weren\'92t sure about the baby monitor\'92s accuracy so they wanted to clip something to the baby\'92s head.\
  We got my wife up on the bed, which was very painful for her, then the doctor did an examination and found that my wife was 6cm dilated. They somehow clipped a little monitor to the baby\'92s head inside my wife and my wife got back down off the bed and laboured in the chair.\
  The midwife removed the bed that was in the room, and brought in another bed that was more suitable for a birth with epidural.\
  All of this was across hours, with my wife biting hard on the gas and air every time she had a contraction, and using it also more to blow into and regulate her breath than to take down too much gas.\
  The doctors came back in. They were an ominous presence. They said the baby\'92s heart rate kept dropping when my wife had contractions so now my wife had to get on the bed and lay sideways to see if that would help. We waited for a contraction to pass so me and the midwife could help my wife onto the bed.\
  We turned my wife from one side to another, trying to get the baby\'92s heart rate to stabilise. Eventually the doctors came in and examined my wife and said she was fully dilated so now she could begin to push. She was laying on her back in the bed. I asked whether this was the best position for her. I meant that she should be on all fours or leaning over the back of the bed - not on her back, basically. The doctors didn\'92t answer me directly but they brought out some stirrups and attached them to the bed. That hadn\'92t been what I meant but I realised now that the weight of medical authority was pressing down on us.\
  They cut my wife open and we all shouted at her to push. I didn\'92t look down, I just looked at my wife\'92s face. I didn\'92t want to know how the baby was doing moment to moment, I just wanted to encourage my wife and trust that things would be ok. The doctors said they would need to use a kiwi which was a little vacuum sucker that attached to the baby\'92s head. We shouted at my wife to push. She looked very scared and kept asking when she should push. She told the doctors they needed to tell her exactly when to push and when to stop but they kept not doing that. They seemed slightly annoyed at her when she asked if she should carry on pushing. They asked did she not know whether she was still having a contraction but she was confused and scared and just wanted clarity rather than a convincing argument on why they shouldn\'92t need to answer her questions. I eventually took over telling her what to do, and had to make educated guesses as to when she was finished with her contractions. The doctors threatened my wife by saying that if the baby didn\'92t come out on this push then they would get the forceps out. She pushed once more and I didn\'92t know whether she would be able to do it but she did.\
  The baby came out and I immediately burst into tears because no one had died. I asked whether it was a boy or a girl and they said it was a girl. They roughed the baby up with a towel, got it crying, and then put it on my wife\'92s chest for a tiny second. Then they told me that the baby had had its cord clamped for a minute so they were going to cut the cord. They had the scissors over the cord and they asked me if I wanted to cut it and I said no, what a stupid thing to offer, I thought. \
  Then I was given the baby. I sat there with my top off, and our daughter grabbed at my chest hair, shoving it in her mouth as though she might feed from it. I watched the placenta come out of my wife. Then they sewed her up and I sat with the baby and me and my wife exchanged confused words. My wife made some small talk with the midwife and the doctors, asking them if they\'92d had a busy night as though she was talking to a taxi driver.\
  Eventually the midwife gave the baby to my wife and the baby fed roughly on her breasts. Things quietened down. The doctors cleared out and the midwife popped in occasionally to move things in the room and to check on us. We held our daughter in our arms.\
